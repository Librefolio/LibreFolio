# Writing tests for LibreFolio

## The one idea

Every test in this repository runs against **one shared database** and **one shared
backend**, at the same time as its neighbours. Backend units run in parallel
processes; frontend blocks run in parallel browser contexts.

So a test may **never assume**. It must **verify**. Every rule below is that one
sentence applied somewhere:

| the test assumes… | …and the truth is |
|---|---|
| its row is first | a neighbour just inserted one |
| there are 3 items | a neighbour created a fourth |
| 500 ms is enough | the machine was busy |
| the row is still splittable | a neighbour split it |
| the element is absent | it was merely slow |
| the button says "Save" | the UI is in Italian today |

**Serialising the suite does not fix any of these. It hides all of them.**

---

## Before writing a line

| you are writing | read | use skill |
|---|---|---|
| backend test | `.github/instructions/backend-testing.instructions.md` | `testing-backend` |
| frontend E2E / Vitest | `.github/instructions/frontend-testing.instructions.md` | `testing-frontend` |
| a Svelte **component** test | same file, section *Component tests (Vitest + jsdom)* — plus the two reference specs it names | `testing-frontend` |
| a test that touches an existing area | — | `wiki-search` first: the problem may already be solved and documented |
| a test that fails and you do not know why | — | `test-triage`. **`flaky` is not a verdict.** |
| formatting the result | — | `lint-format` (backend) / `lint-format-frontend` (frontend) |

Also run `wiki-search` before touching providers, FIFO, async I/O, EditBuffer or FX:
these have history, and rediscovering it costs more than reading it.

---

## The rules — normative, both stacks

### 1. Never identify data by position

```python
# ✘ backend
asset = resp.json()["items"][0]

# ✔ identified by what this test created
created = (await client.post(f"{API_BASE}/assets", json={"display_name": name}, headers=h)).json()
asset = next(a for a in resp.json()["items"] if a["id"] == created["id"])
```

```ts
// ✘ frontend
await page.getByTestId('asset-row').first().click();

// ✔ filtered to the row this spec owns
await page.getByTestId('asset-row').filter({hasText: name}).click();
```

`.first()` / `[0]` is fine on an **already-filtered** collection, where it resolves to
one element by construction. It is the *unfiltered* one that is the defect.

**If it pages, walk the pages** and fail with "not found in N pages". Never assert on
page 1 and hope.

### 2. Never assert a count you did not create

```python
assert {a1, a2, a3} <= {a["id"] for a in items}     # ✔ mine are there
assert len(items) == 3                              # ✘ unless the count IS the subject
```

Legitimate only when cardinality is what is under test (a `page_size`, a bulk
operation's result) and the collection is owned entirely by the test.

### 3. Never wait on the clock

`time.sleep()` and `page.waitForTimeout()` are **forbidden in new tests**. They are a
bet on machine speed, and concurrency takes the other side of it.

Poll the condition, with a deadline. On the frontend, Playwright assertions already
retry — a sleep *before* one is dead weight, a sleep *instead* of one is a guess.

**But you must know which construct retries before you delete anything.** Removing a
sleep in front of something that does *not* retry does not make the test faster: it
makes it stop testing, and it still reports green.

| retries — a sleep here is pure latency, delete it | does **not** retry — the sleep is load-bearing |
|---|---|
| `expect(locator).toBeVisible / toBeHidden / toBeEnabled / toBeDisabled` | `locator.count()` |
| `expect(locator).toHaveCount / toHaveText / toHaveValue / toHaveAttribute / toHaveClass` | `locator.textContent()` / `allTextContents()` |
| `expect.poll(() => …)` | `locator.getAttribute()` / `inputValue()` |
| `locator.waitFor()` | `locator.evaluate()` |
| `locator.click()` — auto-waits for actionability **and stability**; it will not click a moving element, so an animation sleep before a click is always dead weight | `locator.isVisible()` — **its `timeout` option is ignored**; it answers about *this instant* |

For the right-hand column the fix is not deletion, it is **transformation**: turn the
one-shot read into a retrying assertion, or wrap it in `expect.poll`. `e2e/fixtures/probe.ts`
exists for the common case — `appears(locator, ms)` is the honest form of
`isVisible().catch(() => false)`.

**`expect.poll` on a `Locator` is a trap.** `expect()` is overloaded on `Locator`, so
`expect.poll(() => findRow(page, id)).toBeNull()` does not apply the plain-value matcher
you think it does — it burns the whole timeout and fails on a page where the row is
demonstrably gone. Poll a **number**, or better, assert `toHaveCount(0)` on a precise
locator you captured *before* the action:

```ts
// ✘ times out even when the row is gone
await expect.poll(() => findRowByText(page, name)).toBeNull();

// ✔ precise, retrying, and cheap — no textContent() scan of 100+ rows per attempt
const rowId = await row.getAttribute('data-row-id');
await deleteIt();
await expect(page.locator(`tr[data-row-id="${rowId}"]`)).toHaveCount(0);
```

### 4. If there is nothing to wait for, the product is missing a state

Do not hunt for a cleverer selector. **If nothing observable says the operation
finished, the user cannot tell either.** Publish the state once and both benefit.

```svelte
<div data-testid="assets-page" aria-busy={busy} data-busy={busy ? 'true' : 'false'}>
```

```ts
await waitForSettled(page);              // e2e/fixtures/app-events.ts
```

**The tell is in the comment.** *"extra settle time"*, *"let it load"*, *"wait for X to
finish"* — each one names a state the product does not expose.

**And a section that has not rendered yet is the same trap without a sleep.** A block
gated on fetched data (`{#if supportsComparison}`) is absent both when the feature is
unsupported and when the fetch is still in flight, so waiting for it silently measures
network latency. Wait for the gate, not the gated: `RiskAnalysisPanel` publishes
`data-catalog="pending|ready"` for exactly this.

> **If how to surface it is not obvious, stop and ask the user.** It is an interface
> decision, not a test detail. Do not invent a signal unilaterally.

### 5. Never assert on translated text

The UI ships in EN/IT/FR/ES. Assert the **variant** or the **event**, never the message.

```ts
await expect(page.getByTestId('toast-success')).toBeVisible();   // ✔ variant is a contract

const since = await eventSeq(page);
await commitButton.click();
const ev = await waitForEvent(page, 'tx.import.committed', {since});
expect(ev.detail.imported).toBe(47);                              // ✔ structured payload
```

Product side: `notify()` in `$lib/stores/app/notify.svelte.ts`. The toast is the human
half, the event the machine half — **one notification, two halves**, which is why
`toast` is a field of `notify()` and not a separate call.

Never use `page.on('console')`: a console message is an **edge** that must be armed
before the action, and `debug` is compiled out of the production build the suite runs
against. The event ring buffer is a **state** — arriving late costs nothing.

### 6. Never let a probe decide whether to act

```ts
// ✘ turns "slow" into "absent", skips its own setup in silence, fails elsewhere
if (await field.isVisible({timeout: 1000}).catch(() => false)) await field.fill('x');

// ✔ if it is always there on this path, say so and let the timeout speak
await expect(field).toBeVisible({timeout: 5_000});
await field.fill('x');
```

Before writing the conditional, **read the component**. If the element is always
rendered on that path, the defensiveness is not caution — it is a silencer.

### 7. Verify the precondition, do not infer it

Filtering to the right *kind* of row is not the same as finding one that can still do
what you need.

```ts
// ✘ "paired" is necessary, not sufficient — someone may have split this one already
const id = await findPairedRowId(page);

// ✔ scan candidates, keep the first that actually offers the action
const id = await findSplittableRowId(page);
```

**If the test depends on a state it did not create, it must check for that state.**

### 8. Whoever writes, cleans up

Do not assume the database was just populated. `Transaction` has no `user_id`: what one
test commits, every later test sees. Restore what you wrote, or create your own row with
a unique marker and delete it.

### 9. Tests do not start servers

The backend is an **environment resource**, started once by the runner.
`_TestingServerManager` attaches to the shared backend when
`LIBREFOLIO_TEST_SHARED_SERVER` is set. Do not bypass it, do not spawn uvicorn: it takes
the port from everyone else and makes the category serial by construction.

### 10. Never reach a third party over the network

A test that calls the real ECB is testing today's weather. Use `MOCKFX`, `MOCKFX_FAIL`
and their asset-source equivalents — they return fixed values, which lets the assertion
be **exact** instead of "some number arrived".

### 11. Exclusivity requires a written reason

Wanting the resource to yourself is allowed. Wanting it silently is not.

```python
add_test(api, "auth", api_auth, name="Auth API", desc="Register, login, logout, me",
    exclusive_because="rewrites global_settings.enable_registration, one row shared by "
                      "every user: a concurrent unit would register against whatever "
                      "value this one left behind")
```

```ts
test.describe.configure({mode: 'serial'});
// Why: this block owns two browser contexts created in beforeAll and keeps them
// across tests — a shared resource with an order, not an accident.
```

"It's easier" is not a reason. `exclusive_because` **is** the declaration, not a comment
beside a flag.

### 12. A captured fixture that fails the schema is a STOP, not an edit

Some fixtures are **real snapshots captured by a human from a real system** (e.g.
`frontend/e2e/dashboard-report.json` — a user's actual dashboard report). When such a
fixture stops validating against the current schema (zodios rejects it, the page renders
zeroed data):

- **Never** patch, trim or "sanitize" the snapshot to make it pass. Deleting the
  offending blocks fabricates a system state that never occurred, and the screenshots/
  assertions built on it become fiction — while staying green.
- **Stop and ask the user** for a fresh capture (or ask whether the schema changed on
  purpose and the fixture owner should re-record it). If the snapshot can be
  regenerated deterministically from the populated test backend, regenerate it — same
  shape, fresh data — otherwise it is the user's call.
- When a fresh capture of `dashboard-report.json` lands (it's a REAL user snapshot):
  **renormalize it before commit** with `./dev.py mkdocs normalize-dashboard-fixture`
  (scales every monetary figure so net worth = 50 000, keeping quantities, percents and
  ids invariant; verify with `--dry-run` first). If the report schema changed and the
  script fails its invariant checks, update the script — same logic — until it passes.
- Until the fresh capture lands, prefer the test **failing loudly** over passing on
  fabricated input.
- Synthetic mocks you author yourself (in-spec objects) are exempt — they are yours to
  change. The rule covers captured real-world snapshots.

### 13. A unique name must actually be unique

```ts
const suffix = Date.now().toString().slice(-6);   // ✘ four workers, one millisecond
const suffix = uniqueSuffix();                     // ✔ e2e/fixtures/unique.ts
```

Workers start in bursts. This is not theory: it produced
`UNIQUE constraint failed: brokers.name` on `CA Contract 313578`, and the collision was
read as a product bug for an afternoon. A suffix must mix time **with worker identity and
randomness**, never time alone.

### 14. On a toggle, assert the end state — never click blind

```ts
// ✘ closes the section for every asset that opens it by itself
await page.getByTestId('more-info-toggle').click();

// ✔ ask for the state, act only if it is not already there
if (!(await panel.isVisible())) await toggle.click();
await expect(panel).toBeVisible();
```

`AssetModal.svelte:595` does `moreInfoExpanded = identifierRows.length > 0`: the section
opens itself when the asset has identifiers. A helper that clicks unconditionally works
on the fixtures it was written against and inverts everywhere else.

### 15. `waitForSettled` needs the container to publish `data-busy`

It waits for a `[data-busy]` **descendant** to attach. Point it at a container that never
publishes the flag and it burns the whole timeout, then fails — 11 tests died at ~23s
each this way. Check the component first; if the flag is missing, **adding it is the fix**
(see rule 4), not switching to a different wait.

### 16. A counter barrier samples before the action

```ts
// ✘ proves *a* run happened, not that it covered your change
await expect(modal).toHaveAttribute('data-validate-runs', /^[1-9]/);

// ✔ proves a run happened *after* you acted
const before = await validateRuns(page);
await applyButton.click();
await expect.poll(() => validateRuns(page)).toBeGreaterThan(before);
```

A monotonic counter is strictly better than a boolean flag, but only if read as a
**delta**. `!= '0'` is the same bet as a sleep, wearing a counter's clothes.

### 17. An absence assertion needs a presence barrier — and often the wrong matcher

```ts
// ✘ also passes when the PDF viewer has not mounted yet, *and* counts hidden nodes
await expect(page.locator('[data-epdf-i="comment-button"]')).toHaveCount(0);

// ✔ prove the thing is there, prove a sibling control is visible, then prove
//   the part you want gone is not usable
await expect(page.locator('[data-epdf-i]').first()).toBeVisible();
await expect(page.locator('[data-epdf-i="search-button"]')).toBeVisible();
await expect(page.locator('[data-epdf-i="comment-button"]')).toBeHidden();
```

`toHaveCount(0)` is satisfied by "nothing rendered". A test written this way passes
**because** the app was slow — the exact inverse of a sleep, and just as false. One did:
the PDF preview's comment button assertion stayed green for as long as EmbedPDF took more
than eight seconds to appear.

Adding the barrier turned it deterministically red, which exposed the second half:
**`toHaveCount` counts DOM nodes and never looks at visibility**, while that viewer
disables a feature by *hiding* the control rather than unmounting it. The control had
been correctly hidden all along. When the question is "can the user reach this?", the
matcher is `toBeHidden()` / `not.toBeVisible()`, not a count.

The sibling assertion is what gives the negative teeth: without it, "the comment button
is not visible" also becomes true the day the whole toolbar disappears.

Before writing a negative assertion, ask what makes the *positive* observable, assert
that first, and check whether you are asking about existence or about visibility.

### 18. A cached call is not an observable event

```ts
// ✘ the request only happens on a cache miss; on a hit this waits forever
const res = page.waitForResponse((r) => r.url().includes('/risk/query'));
await tab.click();
await res;

// ✔ wait for the state the click produces, whatever served it
await tab.click();
await expect(page.getByTestId('asset-detail-risk-panel')).toBeVisible();
await expect(page.getByTestId('asset-detail-risk-loading')).toHaveCount(0);
```

`queryRisk` keeps a module-level cache: the panel's mount calls it with `force=false`, the
refresh button with `force=true`. The same click therefore emits a request or not depending
on what the page already fetched, and under load the ordering changes. Waiting on the
network is right only when the request **is** the subject (proving a refresh really reaches
the server); when it is scaffolding, wait for the state.

### 19. A helper ends on the post-condition it promises

The commonest sleep in this suite was the last line of a helper: `await cancel.click();
await page.waitForTimeout(300);`. That sleep is the helper hedging on behalf of a caller
it cannot see. Say instead what the helper claims to have achieved — it is shorter, it is
faster, and it fails at the helper instead of three assertions later:

| the helper did | it ends on |
|---|---|
| clicked Cancel / Close / Escape | `await expect(modal).toBeHidden()` |
| `input.fill(v)` | `await expect(input).toHaveValue(v)` |
| opened a `<details>` | `await expect(details).toHaveAttribute('open', '')` |
| clicked a wizard's Continue | `await expect(button).toBeHidden()` |
| landed on a step that fetches | `await waitForSettled(page.getByTestId('…-step2'))` |
| opened a modal that lists rows | `await expect(modal.locator('tbody tr[data-row-id]').first()).toBeVisible()` |

Reaching a container is not the same as the container being usable: `import-wizard-step2`
is visible before its broker files have loaded, which is why it publishes `data-busy`.

### 20. Shared testid prefixes need a closing barrier

Every `SearchSelect` in the app renders its options as `search-select-option-*`. Two
selects filled back-to-back therefore have overlapping option sets in the DOM for as long
as the first is closing, and `.first()` silently picks from the **wrong list**. This is
what the 300 ms sleeps between dropdowns were covering, badly. Assert the DOM is empty of
options before opening the next one:

```ts
await optionsClosed(page); // e2e/fixtures/probe.ts
```

The general rule: when a testid identifies a *kind* rather than an *instance*, an index
into it is only meaningful once you have proved nothing else of that kind is on screen.

---

## Parallelism — how a test declares what it shares

| backend | frontend |
|---|---|
| `add_test(isolation=…)` in the catalogue | nothing: `fullyParallel: true` is the default |
| `exclusive_because="…"` | `mode: 'serial'` **with a written reason** |
| `--assume-scoped` (experiment only) | — (no equivalent; see below) |

Default: backend units declare their isolation; frontend tests are **parallel unless a
block opts out**. The unit of parallelism is the *test*, not the file — a worker
interleaves tests from many spec files against one backend and one database.

So a new test is written to run beside strangers from the start. In practice that means
the three rules above are not style advice: own your data, find it instead of assuming
its position, and never assert on a global count.

`E2E_FORCE_PARALLEL` is **obsolete** — it only set `fullyParallel`, and Playwright offers
no config override for a describe-level `mode`. Re-testing an existing exception is a
source edit: comment out its `mode: 'serial'`, run the category at `--workers 4`, then
delete the declaration with the run as evidence or restore it with the reason updated.

**If you write cleanup code, scope it to what the test created.** "Delete everything that
appeared since I started" is a description of another worker's rows too.

---

## Where a test goes

| kind | path | register in |
|---|---|---|
| API endpoint | `backend/test_scripts/test_api/` | `scripts/test_runner/_backend_api.py` |
| service / unit | `backend/test_scripts/test_services/` | `scripts/test_runner/_backend_services.py` |
| DB / migration | `backend/test_scripts/test_db/` | `scripts/test_runner/_backend_db.py` |
| schema | `backend/test_scripts/test_schemas/` | `scripts/test_runner/_backend_schemas.py` |
| utility | `backend/test_scripts/test_utilities/` | `scripts/test_runner/_backend_utils.py` |
| provider (external) | `backend/test_scripts/test_external/` | `scripts/test_runner/_backend_external.py` |
| backend end-to-end | `backend/test_scripts/test_e2e/` | `scripts/test_runner/_backend_api.py` |
| frontend E2E | `frontend/e2e/{area}/{name}.spec.ts` | `scripts/test_runner/_frontend_{area}.py` |
| frontend unit (logic) | `frontend/src/**/*.test.ts` (Vitest, node env) | `_frontend_utility.py` → `front_utility_unit`, action `core-unit` |
| frontend component | `frontend/src/lib/components/**/X.test.ts` (Vitest + jsdom) | `_frontend_utility.py` → `front_component_unit`, action `component-unit` |

Frontend runner modules, one per category: `_frontend_{ai_export,asset,broker,fx,
portfolio,transaction,user,utility}.py`.

A test that is not in the catalogue does not exist: `all-backend` and the `front-*`
categories run the registry, not the filesystem. **Registering is part of writing it.**

```bash
./dev.py test check-orphans      # finds test files nobody registered
```

Run it before declaring done. A file it lists is a file that never runs.

### Choosing the isolation class (backend)

`add_test(..., isolation=…)` — the four classes are in `scripts/test_runner/_inventory.py`:

| class | means | pick it when |
|---|---|---|
| `PURE` | no DB, no server | pure functions, converters, schema validation |
| `READ` | reads shared data, writes nothing | GET-only endpoints, listings, computations |
| `WRITE_SCOPED` | writes only rows it owns | creates its own user/broker and stays inside |
| `WRITE_GLOBAL` | writes shared surfaces | settings, FX rates, prices, anything global |

**The trap the file warns about:** only `UserSettings` and `BrokerUserAccess` carry a
`user_id`. `Asset`, `Transaction`, `PriceHistory`, `FxRate`, `Broker` and every settings
table are **global**. `Transaction` has no `user_id` at all — it hangs off `broker_id`
and is scoped only at service level. So `WRITE_SCOPED` is far narrower than it looks.

When unsure, pick the **stricter** class: a wrong `WRITE_GLOBAL` costs seconds, a wrong
`WRITE_SCOPED` costs a red nobody can reproduce.

---

## Running what you wrote

```bash
./dev.py test api all                    # a backend category
./dev.py test services all
./dev.py test all-backend                # everything backend

./dev.py test front-asset all            # a frontend category
./dev.py test front-transaction tx-tooltips
./dev.py test --coverage front-transaction all
```

Useful flags — **global, so they go before the category**:

| flag | why you want it |
|---|---|
| `--workers N` | run isolation-safe units in parallel. **This is the check that matters.** |
| `--fresh-run` | clear the run cache first. **Start every campaign with this.** |
| `--resume` | re-run only what has not passed yet |
| `--log-dir PATH` | one log file per unit; previous logs are archived and compressed. Defaults to `.testLog` |
| `--log-file PATH` | the whole run into one file |
| `--fail-fast` | stop at the first red instead of running everything |
| `--assume-scoped` | ignore isolation declarations (experiment only, never commit under it) |

`./dev.py test -q --workers 4 --log-dir /tmp/lf_logs services all`

### The cache: `--fresh-run` first, `--resume` after a fix

The runner remembers which units passed, in a cache that **survives between
invocations**. The three states are not what they look like:

| | clears the cache | which units run |
|---|---|---|
| `--fresh-run` | **yes** | all |
| *neither flag* | **no** | all |
| `--resume` | no | **only those not already marked passed** |

So omitting both is **not** the same as `--fresh-run`: the units all run, but the
cache is still whatever a previous invocation left there. The next `--resume`
then reads that stale cache and skips units on the strength of a run you are no
longer thinking about.

**The rule: `--fresh-run` to open a campaign, `--resume` only to re-check a fix.**

This is not hypothetical. A full run ended 14/15; `--resume` was used to re-check
the one red and executed **two tests** out of the whole suite — correctly, since
everything else was marked passed — but the coverage report that came out said
*"No JS coverage data collected"*, because almost nothing had been measured. A
`--resume` result is evidence about the units it actually ran, and about nothing
else: read the count before believing the summary.

Extra positional args after `<category> <action>` become a pytest `-k` filter.

Long or truncated output goes to `/tmp/libreFolio_<descr>.log` — never re-run an
expensive suite just to see what scrolled past.

---

## Definition of done

Do not report a test as finished until **all** of these are true.

- [ ] It passes.
- [ ] It passes **again**, in the same invocation as its whole category.
- [ ] It passes with the category run in parallel (`./dev.py test --workers 4 <category> all`,
      which is how the suite ships) — or the exclusivity is declared **with a reason**.
- [ ] The green comes from a run that **actually executed it**: a `--resume` invocation
      skips whatever the cache already calls passed, so its summary is evidence about a
      handful of units, not about the suite. Open with `--fresh-run`.
- [ ] It contains no `sleep` / `waitForTimeout`.
- [ ] It contains no unfiltered `.first()` / `[0]`, no literal count it did not create.
- [ ] It asserts on `data-testid` / event payloads, never on CSS classes or translated text.
- [ ] It restores what it wrote.
- [ ] It is registered in the runner catalogue (`./dev.py test check-orphans` is clean).
- [ ] Lint and format pass (`lint-format` for backend, `lint-format-frontend` for frontend).

**A test that fails is information. A test that passes for the wrong reason is a lie
the suite will keep telling.** Prefer a red that means something over a green that
means nothing.

---

## When a test fails

1. Use the **`test-triage`** skill. First hypothesis is always *"was it the shape of the
   response?"*
2. Does it fail **serially too**? Then concurrency is not the cause — the test has an
   order dependency that one-invocation-per-file was hiding.
3. Is it the test or the product? Ask the question honestly. A concurrency red is very
   often a **real defect** that low load was masking.

> A real case worth remembering. `AssetSearchAutocomplete` dropped any query typed
> before the provider list had loaded: the debounce had already fired and nothing
> retried, so the search box just sat there dead. At one worker the providers always
> won the race, so the suite had been green for months. Four workers made a rare
> condition normal, and a *user-facing* bug fell out of a test run.
>
> The fix was in the product, not the spec. Consider that outcome every time.

> And a second one, same shape. Four WAC tests were red only under load, always the same
> four, green in isolation. `useValidateScheduler` sampled its anti-bounce key **when the
> response arrived** instead of when the request left, so an edit made while the server
> was thinking got marked as already-validated and was never re-checked. For a user on a
> slow connection: *the change you make while it is loading is silently not verified.*
> Four tests waiting on a preview that would never update looked exactly like four flaky
> tests.

**How to tell them apart, cheaply.** The backend traceback is in the E2E log on the
`[WebServer]` lines — `grep -E "Traceback|IntegrityError|OperationalError"` on the run log
separates "the product threw" from "the test guessed" in one command. And read
`test-results/**/error-context.md` (the accessibility snapshot of the failing moment)
**before** relaunching: the directory is wiped at the start of every run.

---

## When to stop and ask the user

- The product has no signal to wait for and the right way to expose it is a design call.
- A test seems to need exclusive access and you cannot write the reason in one sentence.
- The fix would change user-visible behaviour (a toast, a disabled control, an error path).
- Mock data would have to change (`backend/test_scripts/test_db/populate_mock_data.py`)
  and other tests may depend on the rows you would move.

Autopilot does not mean guessing about interfaces. Guess about implementation; **ask
about contracts.**
