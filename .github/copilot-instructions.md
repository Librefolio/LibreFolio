# LibreFolio — Copilot Instructions

## What is LibreFolio

LibreFolio is a **self-hosted, open-source financial portfolio tracker** — alternative to Ghostfolio. It supports traditional assets (ETFs, stocks, bonds, crypto), multi-provider FX rates, technical analysis (EMA, MACD, RSI, Bollinger), import from 11+ brokers, and versioned AI Export for factual datasets and analysis-ready prompts.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Details |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Backend** | Python 3.13 + FastAPI | SQLModel/SQLite, Alembic, Pipenv |
| **Frontend** | SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 | Tailwind CSS 4, ECharts 6, Zodios, Playwright |
| **Docs** | MkDocs Material | i18n (suffix strategy), Mermaid, LaTeX (KaTeX) |
| **Deploy** | Docker single-image | Backend serves frontend as static files |
| **CLI** | `dev.py` | Single entry point for everything |

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **All calculations in Backend** — the frontend is pure presentation
2. **FIFO at Runtime** — cost matching computed on-demand, not persisted
3. **Provider Registry Pattern** — auto-discovery for FX, Asset and BRIM providers with `params_schema` for dynamic forms
4. **Multi-Provider with Fallback** — FX rates from ECB→FED→BOE→SNB + MANUAL sentinel
5. **Svelte 5 Runes** — `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect` in new components
6. **Zodios API Client** — types from OpenAPI, Zod runtime validation
7. **Data Separation prod/test** — completely isolated folders
8. **Dual View** — card grid + DataTable for Assets and FX, toggle persisted in localStorage
9. **AI Export Boundary** — backend owns deterministic versioned facts; frontend owns safe prompt rendering, localization, clipboard, and contextual draft memory

## Fundamental Rules

- **Caveman mode ultra** — always active. Use `caveman` skill at `ultra` intensity. Max compression, abbrevs, arrows for causality (X → Y). Off only if user says "stop caveman" or "normal mode".
- **ALWAYS use `./dev.py`** for complex operations — never manual commands
- **Legacy support case-by-case** — tend to migrate to the correct design; keep an old path only with a concrete reason (e.g. not breaking released installs/APIs)
- **Code in English** — comments, docstrings, variables, README
- **Multilingual UI** — only the graphical interface in EN/IT/FR/ES
- **Edit > Rewrite** — prefer targeted edits to avoid regressions
- **Incremental Alembic migrations (released)** — ship schema changes as new migrations to protect existing installs; edit `001_initial.py` only for brand-new never-shipped tables; `db create-clean` only for fresh/test DBs
- **After modifying API** — run `./dev.py api sync` to regenerate TypeScript client
- **After modifying DB models** — add an incremental Alembic migration (`./dev.py db migrate "…"`); use `db create-clean` only for fresh/test DBs
- **NEVER run `git commit`** — the agent must only *propose* commit messages
  (e.g. write them to `/tmp/libreFolio_commit_*.txt` or print them inline).
  The user performs the actual commit manually. Staging (`git add`) and read-only
  git commands (`git status`, `git diff`, `git log --no-pager`) are allowed.
  Same rule for `git push`, `git reset --hard`, `git rebase`, `git checkout -- …`
  and any other history-mutating operation: **never** execute, only suggest.

## Terminal Command Rules

- **Long commands (>10 lines)** → do NOT paste them directly into the shell. Instead, write the command/script to a temporary file under `/tmp/` (e.g. `/tmp/libreFolio_<descr>.sh` or `.py`) and execute that file. This avoids quoting/escape issues and keeps the terminal log readable.
- **Truncated output (`tail`, `head`, `grep -m`, `| head -n`, etc.)** → always `tee` the full output to a file in `/tmp/` *before* truncating, so the complete log can be re-inspected without re-running the command. Pattern:
    ```bash
    <command> 2>&1 | tee /tmp/libreFolio_<descr>.log | tail -n 100
    ```
    Then, if more context is needed, read `/tmp/libreFolio_<descr>.log` instead of re-executing the command.
- **Rationale**: avoid re-running expensive commands (tests, builds, db operations) just to see output that was truncated earlier.

## Async I/O Rule (Event Loop Safety)

In `async def` handlers, **every sync library doing I/O** MUST be wrapped in `await asyncio.to_thread(...)`. Never call `requests.get()`, `yf.Ticker().info`, etc. directly — they block the entire event loop. If an endpoint only does light sync I/O (e.g. `Path.exists()`), define it as `def` (not `async def`).

## Frontend Conventions

- **Svelte 5 Runes**: use `$state()`, `$derived()`, `$effect()` — never old `$:` reactive
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: config via `@theme {}` in `app.css` — no `tailwind.config.ts`
- **Dark mode**: `html.dark` with Tailwind `dark:*` classes
- **Icons**: lucide-svelte
- **Selectors**: always use `data-testid` — never CSS classes or text (fragile with i18n)
- **Flag emoji**: use `Noto Color Emoji` web font for Windows compatibility

## Developer Journal & Plan Methodology

Development history is tracked in `LibreFolio_developer_journal/`. We follow a structured plan-driven workflow:

1. **Plan** → create a detailed implementation plan (`.prompt.md`)
2. **Execute** → implement the plan
3. **Repeat: BugfixPlan + Execute** → for each issue, create a bugfix plan and execute it
4. **Debug** → final verification pass

### File Naming Convention

Plans are saved with an ordered naming scheme that encodes phase, step, iteration, and bugfix round:

```
plan-phase{NN}{Description}.prompt.md              # Main plan
plan-phase{NN}Step{N}{Description}.prompt.md        # Step-level plan
plan-phase{NN}BugfixMigration.prompt.md             # Bugfix iteration
plan-phase{NN}Step{N}Round{N}-{Description}.prompt.md  # Bugfix round N
plan-phase{NN}Step{N}Round{N}{Suffix}.prompt.md     # Sub-iteration (e.g. part2, part3b)
```

When a plan spawns a follow-up, both files cross-link each other (the original links forward, the new one links back).

### Plan Execution — Progress Tracking Rule

When executing a plan, after completing **EVERY step**, immediately return to the plan `.prompt.md` file and:
1. Mark the step as ✅ completed with date
2. Add a line `> **Note implementazione**: ...` describing what was done
3. If there were **detours** (unexpected fixes, discoveries, errors), note them with `> **⚠️ Fuori pista**: ...`

**Do not wait until the end** — update after each step. If context resets mid-execution, nothing is lost.

### Archive Structure

Completed plan chains are moved into `LibreFolio_developer_journal/RoadmapV4_UI/phases/`:

```
phases/
├── phase-{NN}-{name}.md          # Summary plan for the phase
├── phase-{NN}-subplan/           # All sub-plans, bugfix rounds, checklists
│   ├── README.md                 # Index of all sub-plans with status
│   ├── Bugfix-Step{N}/           # Grouped by step
│   │   ├── plan-phase{NN}...md
│   │   └── checklist-...md
│   └── ...
└── 00-index.md                   # Master index of all phases
```

Each `phase-{NN}-subplan/README.md` contains a table of all sub-plans with step, description, and status (✅/⏳).

### Skills

Use the `plan-archive` skill for plan verification and archiving operations (see `.github/skills/planning/plan-archive/SKILL.md`).

Use the `find-skills` skill when looking for new capabilities to install (see `~/.github/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md`).

## Persistent Knowledge Layer (devWiki)

`LibreFolio_devWiki/` is the accumulated knowledge base for this project — decisions, patterns, problems solved, entity documentation. It is NOT the source of truth (code is) and NOT user docs (mkdocs is). It is the living memory that compounds across sessions.

**For the main dev agent**, two wiki skills are available:

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|------------|
| `wiki-search` | At the **start** of a task — enrich context with accumulated knowledge before coding |
| `wiki-file` | At the **end** of a session — preserve discoveries, solved problems, decisions made |

**Rule**: before touching code in a domain with prior history (providers, FIFO, async I/O, EditBuffer, FX, etc.), run `wiki-search` first to avoid re-deriving what's already been learned.

**Historian agent**: for full wiki operations (ingest sources, query the wiki, health-check), invoke the `project-historian` agent — the workflows are embedded directly in that agent's instructions.

### Graphify Knowledge Graph

The devWiki is backed by a **graphify knowledge graph** (`LibreFolio_devWiki/graphify-out/graph.json`). Read its real size from `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` rather than from here: as of 2026-09-01 it holds ~1 617 nodes / 2 277 edges / 167 communities, built from **100 files**. A number written in prose ages; the report does not.

> ⚠️ **The graph covers the wiki, not the code.** Its manifest holds ~363 wiki pages against ~91 code files, out of a corpus of ~2 750. So a BFS/DFS query about *accumulated knowledge* is reliable, while one about *the code* answers partially and **looks complete** — which is the dangerous half. A lint on 2026-09-01 found 144 broken source-file references that no graph query would have surfaced, because the graph does not contain the files that were missing; a filesystem check found all of them in a fraction of a second.
>
> Before writing a wiki page, run `python3 LibreFolio_devWiki/check_source_paths.py`. Every path cited in a `## Source files` table must exist. And remember that **a plan is not a chronicle**: a path read out of a proposal is not a path that was delivered.

- `wiki-search` uses graphify BFS/DFS as primary lookup (much faster than reading raw files)
- `./dev.py graph update` — incremental code-only rebuild after code changes (no LLM, ~5s)
- `./dev.py graph viz` — regenerate `graph.html` for browser visualization
- `./dev.py graph query "TOPIC"` — quick BFS query from the CLI
- Full semantic rebuild (new .md files): invoke the `graphify` skill through the AI assistant

## Changelog Rules (CHANGELOG.md)

The repo-root `CHANGELOG.md` is bundled into the app at build time and shown in the
in-app changelog modal (sidebar version click → foldable panels). Keep it accurate.

**Structure** — Keep a Changelog, SemVer:
- One chapter per release: `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` (`## [Unreleased]` has no date
  and is supported — the parser keeps it).
- Inside a chapter: `###` sections, always with the leading emoji —
  `### 🧪 Beta` (beta subsystems), `### ✨ Added`, `### 🔄 Changed`, `### 🐛 Fixed`,
  `### ⚠️ Breaking changes`. Add an optional free-text intro paragraph before the
  first `###` to present the release in two or three sentences.
- `####` sub-headings group related items inside a `###` section (e.g.
  `#### 🧠 Technical Analysis — backend Signals platform`); each carries an emoji too.
- The modal folds `##` → `###` → `####` progressively, so headlines must be
  self-explanatory: the detail lives in the bullet list under them.

**Keeping it up to date**:
- While a release is being prepared, its chapter is the single place that accumulates
  user-visible changes (features, fixes, breaking notes) — add entries as work lands.
- On release: set the chapter date, tag `vX.Y.Z`; the next Docker/CI build bundles it.
- Entries are user-facing: no internal refactors unless they change observable behavior.
- The in-app modal also links to the remote file; GitHub Releases notes can point here.

## Writing Tests

**Every test runs against one shared database and one shared backend, alongside its
neighbours.** So a test may never *assume* — it must *verify*: no fixed positions, no
global counts, no clock waits, no assertions on translated text.

**Agent**: for writing, rewriting or repairing any test (backend or frontend), invoke the
`test-author` agent — the rules, the isolation classes, the runner registration and the
definition of done are embedded in `.github/agents/test-author.agent.md`.

| Skill | When |
|-------|------|
| `testing-backend` | pytest suites, coverage, catalogue |
| `testing-frontend` | Playwright E2E, Vitest, parallelism per block |
| `test-triage` | a red whose cause is not obvious — **before** calling anything "flaky" |

## Test Users

| Username | Password | Role |
|----------|----------|------|
| `e2e_test_user` | `E2eTestPass123!` | Normal user |
| `e2e_test_admin` | `E2eAdminPass123!` | Admin |

## Ports

| Port | Service |
|------|---------|
| 6040 | Backend production |
| 6041 | Backend test mode |
| 6042 | MkDocs serve |
| 5173 | Frontend dev (Vite HMR) |
