## [2026-09-02] file | MWRR pole when the period starts on a data-less day
Filed the beta-reported MWRR cumulative pole (+9.94% on a −1.5% period): deposit on the first NAV day double-counted when the start date had no data. Fixed in the period re-basing (flows embedded in the first snapshot are no longer re-added).
Filed: [[problems/mwrr-pole-dataless-period-start]].

## [2026-09-02] update | CI/CD Release Pipeline
Added the release-tag convention for the F14 in-app update prompt (SemVer vX.Y.Z, stable-only via releases/latest, name free-form, GHCR tags aligned) — user asked for the rule to live in the wiki + dev guide.
Filed: [[concepts/ci-release-pipeline]].

## [2026-09-01] lint-repair | Applying the P0–P3 repair list from the 2026-08-31 lint

**The finding that framed the work.** The lint counted **144 of 1 828 paths** cited in
`## Source files` tables pointing at files that do not exist, and — decisively — **23 of
the 38 pages written in the 2026-08-31 ingest** were among them. The refactors that could
explain staleness are from **June 2026**; the ingest is from **31 August**. So this was
not ageing. **The ingest transcribed paths out of plans without checking them against the
tree.** Everything below follows from treating that as the root cause rather than the
symptom.

### P0 — where the wiki asserted things that are false

- **Three invented paths** (present in no source; constructed because they sounded
  right) replaced with verified ones: `_orphans.py` → `_cli.py` (the check is the
  `check-orphans` action, registered at `_cli.py:462`), `_schedule.py` → `_scheduler.py`,
  `actions/frontend.py` → `_frontend_common.py`. **There is no `actions/` package.**
  A **fourth** invention the lint had not caught: `_resources.py`, also in
  [[sources/p8-runner-parallel-architecture]].
- **[[entities/test-runner]] rewritten from the code.** The old page documented
  `_orchestrator.py`, `_backend_unit.py`, `_e2e.py`, a `suites/` directory, a
  `@registry.register("transactions")` decorator with auto-discovery and a
  `./dev.py test backend --suite transactions` CLI. None of it exists. The real package
  is **30 flat modules, 15 categories, 250 `add_test()` call sites**, with the registry
  built by **14 explicit `populate_registry()` calls** in `_registry.py` — no decorator,
  no discovery — and a CLI of the form `./dev.py test <category> <action>` generated
  from `TEST_REGISTRY.keys()`.
- **[[concepts/backend-test-isolation]] retired, not amended.** It claimed twice that
  `unique_id()` combines timestamp + UUID4. The code
  (`backend/test_scripts/test_utils.py:174-182`) is a millisecond timestamp plus a
  **process-global counter that restarts at 0 in every process** — two workers starting
  in the same millisecond produce the same identifier. The naming convention, which is
  sound and has nothing to do with parallelism, moved to
  [[concepts/unique-test-identifiers]]; the isolation claim is withdrawn in favour of
  [[concepts/test-isolation-classes]]. The page's own 2026-08 caveat was also wrong
  (**56/16** where the truth is **36/7**) and spoke of "**the** `session` fixture" —
  there are **ten**, redefined locally in ten files of `test_services/`, all
  function-scoped, none owned. Centralisation is work to be **built**, not an owner to
  be consulted. Verified totals: **195** test files, **645** `test_` functions in
  `test_api/`.
- **[[decisions/test-runner-package-split]]** — History corrected to 30/15/250 and the
  sentence about an `actions/` reorganisation deleted. The module table is left frozen
  on purpose: the page documents the *rationale* of 2026-06.
- **`frontend/mcr.config.js` removed from 4 pages.** It never existed — it is proposal
  B.3 of `plan-p7-js-coverage.md:227`. Monocart was **removed**
  (`frontend/e2e/fixtures/playwright.ts:297`, *"no monocart here any more"*); coverage is
  istanbul end to end. Each page now says so, because that is information and not merely
  a correction.

### P1 — mass drift

- **233 substitutions across 109 pages** from the 85-entry remap table of the June 2026
  refactors (stores, transaction components, frontend utils, backend financial utils,
  skills). Every destination `ls`-verified before writing. Basename matching alone was
  **not** safe: it proposed `api/v1/brim.py` → `schemas/brim.py`, `ai_export/service.py`
  → `risk/service.py` and three more semantically wrong hits, all rejected by a guard
  that only auto-accepts a move *deeper* into the same directory or a pure prefix
  addition.
- **A further 11 rules, 20 substitutions**, found while repairing: `test_utils/` →
  `test_utilities/`, `fx_service.py` → `fx.py`, `scripts/test_runner.py` →
  `scripts/test_runner/`, `.github/skills/test-triage/` →
  `.github/skills/devpy-tools/test-triage/`, and an **AI-export cluster where the ingest
  had again written the planned names rather than the delivered ones**:
  `AiExportMenuV2.svelte` → `AiExportMenu.svelte`, `aiExportClipboardV2.ts` →
  `aiExportClipboard.ts`, `ai-export.spec.ts` → the `frontend/e2e/ai-export/` directory
  of four specs. The `V2` suffix is a plan artefact; it never shipped.
- **The six absences the lint had already resolved**, plus **9 broken mkdocs paths**
  (`user/brokers.en.md` and `user/settings.en.md` are directories today) — 12
  substitutions.
- **[[problems/utc-today-vs-user-calendar]]** rewritten symbol by symbol. In doing so:
  `resolveDateSentinel` is at `dateRangeStore.svelte.ts:144`, **124 lines from
  `defaultRange()` at L20** — two of the three product defects live in the same file.
- **Twin pairs merged**, descriptive slugs surviving as decided:
  [[sources/phase07-part4-round3-staging-rewrite]] and
  [[sources/phase07-part4-round5-server-type-rules]] absorbed the non-redundant lines of
  the bare-slug copies (which pointed at different `related:` pages), and the copies —
  the wiki's only two orphans — were deleted.

### P2 / P3

- **[[concepts/silent-no-op-option]]** created and linked from the four problems that
  paid for it — `resume-mode-stale-import`, `coverage-mode-stale-import`,
  `coverage-report-category-dest-collision`, `env-var-injection-point-duplicated`. Four
  incidents, one shape: *an option that is accepted, does nothing, and does not say so.*
  Two mechanisms underlie it — `from x import y` freezing a value at import time, and two
  code paths where the design assumed one.
- **[[concepts/assert-on-identity-not-prose]]** created. Its frontmatter pointer had
  existed in [[problems/i18n-key-assertion-false-green]] since 2026-08-31, aimed at a page
  nobody had written.
- **[[features/F-020]]**: the dangling `decisions/fx-triangulation.md` replaced by
  [[decisions/fx-sync-pair-based]] with a line on how they differ, and an explicit note
  that no decision page for the triangulation algorithm exists — a gap, not a broken link.
- **See also added** in [[decisions/settings-write-path-contract]] →
  [[decisions/scheduler-converts-at-decision]].
- **[[sources/coverage-campaign-2026-08]]**: the Final position (78,02 / 59,45 / 90,18)
  now carries its caveat inline instead of forty lines below, plus a per-figure
  reconstruction. The frontend pair is comparable to its neighbours in the campaign.
  **`90,18 %` was initially recorded here as unexplained**; the project owner supplied
  its provenance the same day from `htmlcov-backend/index.html` — it is the **mixed
  lines + branch-arms** formula, the *same one* as 90,10 %, measured on the final
  validation run (`--workers 8`, `--fresh-run`, all three `--cov-clean-*`). So the set
  is **one pure-lines figure (92,33) against four mixed ones** (90,10 · 90,46 · 92,40 ·
  90,18), and the caveat now says which is which — because comparing across those two
  columns is exactly the error the campaign documented and then repeated in its own
  closing line. A hand-check of the five printed numbers does **not** reproduce 90,18:
  `coverage.py` uses `missing_branches` (≈1 917) where the HTML shows `partial` (1 719).
  Recorded, because a figure you cannot reproduce looks wrong when it is not.
  Same treatment applied to the triple in this log.
- **`index.md` reabsorbed**: 439 links / 381 destinations / **58 duplicate rows** →
  348 / 323 / **25**, and 514 → 414 lines. The three "Recent Additions" blocks became one
  **chronological register** under two rules — a page is listed once, on its creation
  date, never again when updated; a bulk ingest is named and counted, not expanded.
  The 60-link bare `F-NNN` dump under "Uncategorized / Auto-Recovered" was deleted (it
  duplicated `features/registry.md` without its information) and the 9 real pages stranded
  there were promoted into the Problems and Decisions tables with proper summaries.
  **"Individual Feature Pages" is now declared a selection**, with
  [[features/registry]] named as the authoritative catalogue — so a feature's absence
  from the index is no longer a defect to be re-flagged.
- **`raw/ingest-registry.md`**: the **14 sources** that lived only in
  `~/.copilot/session-state/` — outside the repository, outside git, in a directory that
  dies with the session — now point at
  `LibreFolio_developer_journal/Release_2/Phase_0/07_coverageAndConsolidationCampaign/`
  and carry content hashes, so drift detection works for them as for everything else. The
  same re-pointing was applied to the `original_path` frontmatter and Source-files rows of
  the **8 source pages** that cited them. Its `INDEX.md` carries the warning these
  particular sources need: **a plan is not a chronicle** — several describe an
  architecture in the future tense, and reading them as a record of what shipped is
  exactly what produced the invented paths above.

### Result

**Non-existent paths: 157 unique / 328 occurrences → 33 unique / 52 occurrences**
(−79 % and −84 %; measured on the same filter before and after, counting only table rows
inside `## Source files`). The remainder are genuine unknowns, not drift: symbols whose
new home cannot be established by matching, and files that appear to have been deleted
rather than moved. They are listed in the repair report and were deliberately **not**
guessed at — guessing is what created the problem this entry describes.

**The empty AI-export packages, resolved.** `ai_export/assemblers/` and `profiles/`
contain nothing but `__pycache__` — stale bytecode, which is the only reason `ls` still
shows the directories and what makes them look like a move. They were **deleted** in
commit **`615a52eb` (2026-08-05)**, *"refactor(ai-export): remove legacy runtime"*:
**22 233 lines removed against 1 577 added**, taking `assemblers/`, `profiles/`,
`resolver.py`, `sampling.py`, `technical.py`, `normalization.py`, `service.py` and their
tests. The commit gives the reason: *"Keep one production path so catalog, prompts, and
tests cannot drift between V3 composition and **an unreachable profile/assembler
stack**."* Not tidying — **a second path that could still be reached and had started to
disagree with the first**, resolved by deleting the loser rather than reconciling them.
Same family as [[problems/registered-but-unreachable-test-actions]] and
[[concepts/silent-no-op-option]]. The two pages that pointed there now name the V3
successors — `components/payloads/portfolio_broker.py`,
`components/portfolio_financial.py`, `components/drawdown_context.py`,
`components/spec.py`, `analyses/spec.py`, `composer.py`, `runtime_service.py` — and carry
a note saying the modules were dismantled, with the commit and the rationale.

A detail worth keeping: the drawdown defect was not settled with a better fallback but by
**removing the fallback shape entirely** — `components/drawdown_context.py:31` reads
*"never fails — there is deliberately no success-shaped fallback"*, returning an explicit
`FAILED`/`UNAVAILABLE` status naming scope and period instead. The same lesson as
[[concepts/silent-no-op-option]], reached from the other side.

**Both pages were written 2026-08-31 — twenty-six days after the deletion.** They named
the deleted modules because they were written from the plan, not from the tree.

**Still open**: `backend/app/api/v1/brim.py` is cited by 5 pages and **no BRIM router
exists** — the endpoints live in `api/v1/brokers.py` and `api/v1/uploads.py`.

## [2026-08-05] update | MkDocs audit capability taxonomy

Updated [[sources/mkdocs-audit-2026-08-05]] with the second-order split:
13 existing-system extensions, 4 new system/library/integration prerequisites,
25 existing-but-undocumented capabilities, 21 editorial-only records, and 1
product ambiguity. Beta Risk Analysis is intentionally excluded. Graph semantic refresh
remains pending because the local Graphify Gemini API key was rejected.

## [2026-08-05] file | MkDocs English Source Audit

Filed [[sources/mkdocs-audit-2026-08-05]] from the completed non-developer English
MkDocs audit. Preserved 182/182 page coverage, 64 evidence-backed discrepancies,
validation results, and the explicit developer-guide deferral.

## [2026-08-05] update | AI Export first public V1 and probe/test boundary

Updated [[decisions/ai-export-versioned-snapshot-boundary]],
[[entities/ai-export-snapshot-service]],
[[concepts/ai-export-catalog-granularity-and-composition]], and
[[sources/phase00-ai-export-backend-snapshot]]. Recorded that internal V2/V3
iterations were never released: snapshot, catalog, selection, instruction and
response contracts start publicly at V1, while component/internal dataset
versions retain their technical history. Functional suites keep 57 fast probe
helper tests but never launch copied-DB prompt generation or Task Adequacy.
Cross-run prompt hashes are diagnostic; same-input UI/probe equivalence remains
byte-exact.
Graph: code-only refresh incorporated the V1 source contracts, then a scoped
semantic refresh replaced the four AI Export wiki pages and regenerated
`graph.json`, `GRAPH_REPORT.md`, and `graph.html`: 1,614 nodes, 2,274 edges,
160 communities. BFS resolves First Public AI Export V1, Functional Test
Boundary, Probe Helpers separation, and diagnostic-only cross-run SHA.

## [2026-08-05] update | AI Export single-runtime V3 final closure

Updated [[decisions/ai-export-versioned-snapshot-boundary]],
[[entities/ai-export-snapshot-service]],
[[concepts/ai-export-catalog-granularity-and-composition]], and
[[sources/phase00-ai-export-backend-snapshot]]. Recorded removal of the complete
profile/assembler/V1-schema runtime, the final 67-component/40-dataset/11-analysis
registry, the 8+11 public catalog, exact-output registry/catalog/stats/envelope
optimizations, zero orphan tests, 114/114 baseline/candidate prompt equivalence,
and 66/66 `OPTIMAL` Analysis variants. Candidate
`20260804T224056.073291Z` is the authoritative closure run.
Graph: scoped semantic refresh replaced 15 historical page nodes with 22
current nodes, pruned 11 obsolete findings, and regenerated `graph.json`,
`GRAPH_REPORT.md`, and `graph.html`: 1,533→1,540 nodes, 2,248→2,222 edges,
150 communities. BFS now resolves the single runtime, 114/114 prompt
equivalence and 66/66 `OPTIMAL` variants.

## [2026-08-04] update | AI Export short-lived session memory and fiscal catalog refinement

Updated [[decisions/ai-export-contextual-ui-memory]] after manual multi-login
testing: durable `localStorage` drafts were replaced by validated
user/context-scoped `sessionStorage` with a sliding ten-minute TTL; logout,
account changes, and every new login reset selection, detail, period, notes, and
Copy Anyway state. The public catalog was reduced from 13 to 11 Analyses by
removing Broker Cost Efficiency and FX Conversion Planning. Portfolio/Broker
fiscal-lot prompts became Capital-Loss Offset Strategies centered on official
tax-loss inventory (`cassetto fiscale`), jurisdiction/regime, category,
origin/expiry, used/remaining balances, legal eligibility, and conditional
no-action/gain-realization/staged/loss-harvesting paths. Targeted run
`20260804T190403.680108Z` rendered 2/2 prompts with source/production DB unchanged
and a passed secret scan. Final frontend cutover passed 32/32 Playwright tests
across desktop/mobile.

## [2026-08-04] file | AI Export catalog granularity and composition

Filed [[concepts/ai-export-catalog-granularity-and-composition]] from
`report-phase00AiExportUiPromptCatalogExplainedV1.md` and updated
[[decisions/ai-export-versioned-snapshot-boundary]],
[[entities/ai-export-snapshot-service]], and
[[sources/phase00-ai-export-backend-snapshot]]. Preserved the 32-dataset /
17-analysis / 65-component catalog shape; confirmed that PAC and Rebalancing
receive per-position unit price, value, WAC, P&L, and weight plus optional
per-Asset market context; distinguished position price, observed market price,
and price history; and recorded canonical `all_data` union semantics.
Documented the principal UX ambiguity (Technical Summary vs Asset Snapshot vs
Asset Comparison vs Technical, Context vs Analysis, and no granularity badges)
plus two unimplemented gaps: Broker Technical lacks a raw price-history
component, and Asset Trend promises Drawdown without composing
`asset.drawdown_context`. Verification covers 49/49 choices; real Portfolio run
`20260804T085052.052297Z` passed 5/5, UI/probe equivalence, secret scan, and
database immutability.
Graph: scoped semantic refresh replaced the four changed AI Export page
fragments, preserved external links, and regenerated `graph.json`,
`GRAPH_REPORT.md`, and `graph.html`: 1,524→1,533 nodes, 2,214→2,255 edges,
144 communities. The semantic incremental queue fell from 242 to 238
pre-existing changes, and queries now resolve the catalog taxonomy, PAC /
Rebalancing composition, three price meanings, `all_data` union, both gaps, and
run `20260804T085052.052297Z`.

## [2026-08-03] update | AI Export applied density policy and final hardening closure

Updated [[decisions/ai-export-technical-series-and-density-contract]],
[[decisions/ai-export-versioned-snapshot-boundary]], and
[[sources/phase00-ai-export-backend-snapshot]]. Recorded the approved and applied
event policy: Compact complete 7 calendar days/minimum latest 3, Standard complete
21 calendar days/minimum latest 10, and Full complete 30 calendar days/minimum
latest 20 per entity/annotation; indicator history remains 5/10/all non-empty rows.
Recorded the project owner's approval of empty-temporal-row hardening, explicit
Broker nomenclature, and `20260801T085820.657238Z` as final targeted evidence.
Applied-policy run `20260803T164514.504966Z` passed 7/7 prompts with zero
failures/public violations, UI/probe equivalence, a passed secret scan, and
unchanged source/production databases. Dense Portfolio/Broker output may exceed
60k, so the UI warning remains and no automatic cap is introduced. Closed the
Developer test-walkthrough and repository-instruction follow-ups; User Guide
IT/FR/ES translations remain explicitly deferred.
Graph: incremental detection found 240 semantic changes overall (237 pre-existing
plus these three AI Export pages). The scoped semantic refresh replaced only the
three AI Export page fragments, preserved their external links, and regenerated
`graph.json`, `GRAPH_REPORT.md`, and `graph.html`: 1,516→1,524 nodes,
2,189→2,214 edges, 144 communities. Post-refresh queries resolve the approved
21d/min10 policy and both final evidence runs.

## [2026-08-03] update | AI Export E2E and contextual-memory hardening

Updated [[decisions/ai-export-contextual-ui-memory]] with reactive async
client-session hydration, V2 per-user/context storage, separate raw Analysis-note
memory, and epoch/operation/session/context guards that make stale preparation
results inert before clipboard, persistence, or callbacks. Recorded the
panel/catalog/memory/contract Playwright split, focused runner actions plus the
cutover alias, and the final canonical gate: 214 unit tests and 32 desktop/mobile
E2E tests passed. The separate density recommendation remains awaiting user
decision and was not filed as resolved.
Graph: incrementally replaced the decision's semantic fragment, regenerated
`graph.json`, `GRAPH_REPORT.md`, and `graph.html`, and verified the four new
hardening concept nodes linked from the existing decision node.

## [2026-08-03] file | AI Export density, news causality, and Transactions NaN loop

Updated [[decisions/ai-export-technical-series-and-density-contract]] with explicit
backend-owned Compact/Standard/Full history and event density, source-row
diagnostics, lossless prompt encoding, and targeted real-prompt measurements.
Created [[decisions/ai-export-news-driver-analysis]] for cited dated web research,
source hierarchy, supported/inferred/speculative links, and unexplained movements.
Created [[problems/transactions-without-asset-filter-nan-loop]] for the
`__null__` → `NaN` reactive navigation loop and explicit `without_asset` state.

## [2026-07-30] update | AI Export Signal Density V2 contract

Updated [[decisions/ai-export-technical-series-and-density-contract]] with the
completed beta-v1 in-place temporal-class sampling and per-entity event-selection
contract, manifest propagation, 18/18 and 54/54 validation, measured Portfolio
Full 1Y reduction from 2,676,781 to 1,990,718 characters, and the known
`fx.rate_ohlc` warm-up blocker. No application, journal, or MkDocs source changed.
Graph: ran the incremental refresh, semantically replaced the updated decision
page, regenerated graph outputs, and verified the new Signal Density V2 nodes.

## [2026-07-30] file | AI Export technical series and density contract

Filed the native-market/target-valuation split, unique per-asset Portfolio/Broker
technical universe, inter-bucket return anchors, observed-only carry-forward and
epsilon semantics, measured Full 1Y density, deferred N=5 reduction candidate,
and removal of public drawdown recovery pending deterministic Risk episodes.
Filed: [[decisions/ai-export-technical-series-and-density-contract]].
Graph: incremental code refresh plus semantic page merge produced 1,461 nodes /
2,070 edges / 142 communities and regenerated `graph.html`; the new decision
node and its cross-links were verified.

## [2026-07-29] file | Risk G6 application contracts

Filed stable/pending-approval G6 decisions for historical-replay proxy audit,
lazy-panel retention/cache identity, present-bucket + Show all shock UX, and
optional inert YAML tags. Shared Foundation and G6-11 remain blocked.
Filed: [[decisions/risk-g6-application-contracts]].

## [2026-07-28] update | Risk backend audit and worker idle lifecycle

Updated the Risk quantitative decision, Sobol contract, Riskfolio dependency trap,
and Phase 0 source with canonical `random_seed`/`sobol_start_index` semantics,
generation-safe idle reap, lazy restart, and the explicit Riskfolio 7.3.0 probe.
Final focused evidence recorded: 74 service, 7 API, 21 schema, and 11 worker
lifecycle tests; frontend check/build and 5 mocked E2E; Docker arm64 build/smoke.
Created: [[problems/risk-spawn-worker-idle-residency]]. Updated:
[[decisions/risk-quant-engine-process-boundary]],
[[problems/quantlib-sobol-seed-skipto]],
[[problems/riskfolio-numpy-vectorbt-dependency-trap]], and
[[sources/phase00-risk-analysis-backend]].
Graph: incremental semantic extraction refreshed five Risk pages, removed modified-page
ghosts, preserved 11 external edges, and regenerated 1,435 nodes / 2,040 edges /
144 communities plus `graph.html`.

## [2026-07-28] file | Phase 0 Risk Analysis backend G0-G5

Filed the corrected quantitative backend: QuantLib MC/QMC and Riskfolio 7.0.1 in separate persistent spawn pools, cancellation-safe content-key deduplication, Sobol `skipTo` seed semantics, crash-safe response pipes, and the exact-version dependency resolution that preserves NumPy 2.5.1 without vectorbt/numba.
Created: [[sources/phase00-risk-analysis-backend]], [[decisions/risk-quant-engine-process-boundary]], [[concepts/cancellation-safe-inflight-deduplication]], [[problems/quantlib-sobol-seed-skipto]], [[problems/spawn-worker-response-queue-semaphore-leak]], [[problems/riskfolio-numpy-vectorbt-dependency-trap]].
Graph: semantic update merged all six pages, reclustered 1,525 nodes / 1,986 edges into 273 communities, and regenerated `graph.html`.

## [2026-07-27] update | Phase 0 AI Export final UI closure and manual approval

Source: completed `LibreFolio_developer_journal/Release_2/Phase_0/01_signalMigration/02_aiExport/README.md` chain @ git:`untracked`. Recorded the custom icon/name/description analysis select; synthetic Data Snapshot → `data_only`; real analyses → `full_prompt`; locale-owned response language; hidden web/compatibility controls; body portal; domain-aware manuals; and final desktop/mobile approval.
Created: [[decisions/ai-export-contextual-ui-memory]] for client-session-user/context-keyed Portfolio, Broker, Asset, and canonical-FX draft persistence, including the invariant that Snapshot remembers hidden notes but never exports them.
Updated: [[sources/phase00-ai-export-backend-snapshot]], [[decisions/ai-export-versioned-snapshot-boundary]], [[decisions/ai-export-prompt-catalog]], [[entities/ai-export-snapshot-service]], [[problems/ai-export-cash-fx-valuation-basis-mismatch]], [[problems/ai-export-drawdown-selected-history-fallback]], [[problems/ai-export-clipboard-fallback-unreachable]].
Archive: the chain is complete in `Release_2/Phase_0/01_signalMigration/02_aiExport/`; no move to `RoadmapV4_UI/phases/` is required.
Graph: ran `./dev.py graph update`, semantically merged the eight changed AI Export wiki pages, reclustered, and regenerated `graph.html`; verified [[decisions/ai-export-contextual-ui-memory]] as a linked graph node.

## [2026-07-26] update | AI Export final-review regressions and canonical test registration

Filed the false Asset drawdown 409 caused by an empty technical window and the unreachable non-modern clipboard transport. Updated the Phase 0 source, snapshot entity, and versioned-boundary decision with the selected-history fallback, prepare-once V2 clipboard behavior, and canonical backend/service/schema/API plus frontend AI Export+signal suite registration; unrelated pre-existing orphan tests remain outside scope.
Created: [[problems/ai-export-drawdown-selected-history-fallback]], [[problems/ai-export-clipboard-fallback-unreachable]].
Updated: [[sources/phase00-ai-export-backend-snapshot]], [[entities/ai-export-snapshot-service]], [[decisions/ai-export-versioned-snapshot-boundary]].
Graph: ran `./dev.py graph update`, cached the five changed wiki pages, and reclustered with no visualization; both new problem nodes were verified linked.

## [2026-07-26] ingest | Phase 0 AI Export backend snapshot and hard cutover

Source: `LibreFolio_developer_journal/Release_2/Phase_0/01_signalMigration/02_aiExport/` plan, frozen task/profile contract, and migration equivalence report @ git:`untracked`. Recorded the 18-task × 3-detail = 54 versioned profile platform, backend-owned factual snapshot boundary, frontend-owned safe prompt/clipboard boundary, fail-closed compatibility, four-surface hard cutover, and MCP-ready service seam.
Created: [[sources/phase00-ai-export-backend-snapshot]], [[decisions/ai-export-versioned-snapshot-boundary]], [[entities/ai-export-snapshot-service]].
Updated: [[decisions/ai-export-prompt-catalog]] (marked superseded by the Phase 0 architecture).

## [2026-07-26] file | AI Export cash FX valuation-basis mismatch

Live E2E showed that Portfolio Engine cash is transaction-date FX valued while native cash exposure is snapshot-date FX valued; an invalid equality invariant produced `portfolio_service.cash_balance_total_mismatch` as HTTP 503. Preserved engine summary/decomposition, kept factual snapshot-valued native cash, and gave `allocation_by_currency_pct` its declared `trading_currency_positions_plus_native_cash_snapshot_value` denominator without changing Portfolio Engine math.

## [2026-07-26] file | Import wizard fake asset-id collision across multiple files

Root-caused marco's prod portfolio corruption (BTP PIU at -917k/-99.99%): the Step-4 merge keyed asset resolutions by bare fake ids that collide across files, binding Intesa's EURIZON seeds onto Crédit Agricole's BTPs. Fixed by namespacing fake ids per-file (unique global allocator) + cloning txs; documented the companion locale numeric-input bug. Filed: [[problems/import-wizard-fake-id-collision]].

## [2026-07-25] file | Crédit Agricole securities-only BRIM cash-neutral model

Recorded the CA BRIM decision: securities-only exports get automatic BUY/SELL cash counter-entries, and succession transfer rows are faithful BUY+DEPOSIT legs rather than ADJUSTMENTs. Filed: [[decisions/credit-agricole-securities-only-cash-neutral-brim]].

## [2026-07-23] file | Backend plugin signals and OpenAPI discriminator workaround

Recorded the Phase 0 technical-signal architecture (pure Python plugins, canonical outputs, one Asset/FX bulk request, local-only comparisons/benchmarks) and the `openapi-zod-client` discriminator type-erasure workaround. Updated the signals domain page. Filed: [[decisions/signal-backend-plugin-architecture]], [[problems/openapi-zod-discriminator-type-erasure]].

## [2026-07-01] ingest | Phase 09 — Portfolio Engine 3-Pool Refactor (commit 39106380)

Source: `LibreFolio_developer_journal/RoadmapV4_UI/phase-09-subplan/Milestone_2/portfolio_engine/` @ HEAD:`d27902b7`.
Major engine refactor: inline WAC single-pass (eliminates N×M `compute_wac_iterative` DB calls), 3-pool K/R/W event-driven state machine with SELL fix (read WAC before reducing pool → correct K/R split on full exit), LAST_BUY_PRICE(V(u)) as price fallback, pre-frame/frame separation (no market eval before t0), range-aware blob cache with fingerprint keys. Supporting analysis docs: architectural analysis, implementation status, P&L breakdown, asset contribution gap analysis.
Created: [[sources/phase09-portfolio-engine-3pool-refactor]], [[concepts/inline-wac-computation]], [[concepts/pre-frame-frame-separation]].
Updated: [[entities/portfolio-engine]] (inline WAC, fallback chain, blob cache, 3-pool, history), [[entities/portfolio-service]] (+612 lines noted, tech debt updated), [[concepts/3-pool-cash-model]] (full K/R/W event-driven semantics, SELL fix, reconciliation invariant).

Source: `LibreFolio_developer_journal/RoadmapV4_UI/phases/phase-07-subplan/Parte4/Round6/PlanD-D1D2/README.md` @ git:`8f363d79`.
Batch ingest of sub-plan bundle (D1 backend batch pipeline, D2 frontend PromoteMergeModal, Centralize payload layer, 4 bugfix rounds). Key insights: `_PromoteCandidate` duck-typing, endpoint elimination (no standalone /split or /promote), centralized txPayloadHelpers.ts + txCommitApi.ts (9 callsites), PMC override UX.

Source: `LibreFolio_developer_journal/RoadmapV4_UI/phases/phase-07-subplan/Standalone/plan-pwa-mobile-optimizations.prompt.md` @ git:`66f56432`.
Archive re-anchor for PWA plan (already ingested as r2-parallel-features-pwa-borsa-fx). Two additional bugfixes captured: Svelte 5 runes reactivity fix for HelpMenu, and beforeinstallprompt race condition fix with early-capture in app.html.
Created: [[sources/phase07-standalone-pwa]].
Updated: [[features/F-098]] (cross-reference only, status remains implemented).

Source: `LibreFolio_developer_journal/RoadmapV4_UI/phases/phase-08-subplan/plan-phase08Step1-2-backend.prompt.md` @ git:`5592f299`.
Embedded FastAPI scheduler daemon with leader election (psutil + file-lock), 2 job types (current-price + history-sync), 5 new settings, fetch_interval column removal, atomic state persistence, JSONL log. Test checkpoint covers Phase 07 Part 5 + Phase 08.

Sources: `wiki_audit_2026_06_18/audit_transactions.md`, `audit_backend_infra.md`, `audit_assets_brokers_brim.md` @ git:`010ec3ed`.
Two critical corrections: WorkspaceIntent is frontend-only Svelte 5 pattern (not backend multi-tenancy); test_runner is now a modular package at scripts/test_runner/ (18 modules, not monolithic .py file). New mkdocs: runner_architecture.md, scheduler.md, transaction-draft.md update. lf-screenshot-carousel component created.

**Created** (1 source page):
- [[sources/r3-sp-d-formmodal-wac-fx-chain]]

**Created** (3 decision pages):
- [[decisions/wac-target-currency-last-acquisition]] — WAC target = last acquisition's currency (deterministic)
- [[decisions/fxsyncmodal-parent-ownership]] — Parent owns FxSyncModal, child calls onOpenFxSync
- [[decisions/blur-detection-format-string-comparison]] — Compare formatDecimalForDisplay() strings for blur detection

**Updated** (2 feature pages):
- [[features/F-097]] — status: in-progress → **implemented** (all walktests pass, E2E added)
- [[features/F-048]] — title updated to reflect SP-D completion

**Key decisions extracted**:
- WAC target currency = most recent acquisition's currency (not majority)
- cost_basis_override is Currency object {code, amount}, sentinel {code, "0"} for auto hint
- FxSyncModal reuse pattern: parent owns modal, child calls onOpenFxSync prop
- Blur detection: compare formatDecimalForDisplay() strings (not numeric tolerance)
- useValidateScheduler: manual triggers bypass antiBounce 10s
- PromoteMergeModal WAC section was dead code → removed
- FX missing does NOT force manual mode (informative error only)

## [2026-06-01] ingest | Batch 4 — Five Independent Mini-Plans

Ingested 5 independent plans (BackendLogAudit, CandlestickChart, FxRangeHelper, LazyImageCache, RsiSignalBands) — all ✅ DONE 2026-06-01.

**Created** (1 source page):
- [[sources/independent-batch-2026-06-01]]

**Created** (3 concept pages):
- [[concepts/log-level-policy]] — 6-level hierarchy, TRACE registration, structlog patch
- [[concepts/image-preview-cache-pattern]] — objectUrl cache, size-based reuse, no ref counting
- [[concepts/fx-range-helper-pattern]] — ensureFxRangeLoaded centralization (DRY 6→1)

**Updated** (4 feature pages):
- [[features/F-076]] — status: planned → implemented (log policy + TRACE)
- [[features/F-080]] — status: planned → implemented (candlestick OHLCV chart)
- [[features/F-086]] — status: planned → implemented (image preview cache)
- [[features/F-039]] — added RSI zone-driven band style details

## [2026-06-02] ingest | Batch 2 — SP-C Bugfix Chain (11 plans: BulkModal + WAC Preview)

Ingested 11 completed plans from SP-C sub-plan (Frontend BulkModal + Suggest UX + WAC bugfixes) @ anchor `84f8bd07`.

**Created** (1 source page):
- [[sources/r2-sp-c-bugfix-chain]] — Combined source covering all 11 plans in the SP-C bugfix dependency chain

**Created** (2 problem pages):
- [[problems/wac-feedback-loop]] — WAC recalc → field update → infinite loop (resolved via cost_basis_mode)
- [[problems/clone-link-uuid-duplication]] — Clone paired rows from DB didn't generate link_uuid (resolved via type-rule check)

**Created** (2 concept pages):
- [[concepts/paired-partner-architecture]] — pairedWith, getPartnerOp, visibleOps, resolveFormItems pattern
- [[concepts/stateless-preview-pattern]] — Controlled components for computed values (WacPreviewSection)

**Created** (1 decision page):
- [[decisions/wac-inline-validate-commit]] — WAC computed in validate/commit, standalone endpoint eliminated from editing flow

**Updated**:
- [[features/F-097]] — Added bugfix chain status history, dead ends, implementation notes (feedback loop, stateless preview, link_uuid)
- [[features/F-048]] — Added SP-C bugfix chain references and related problems/concepts
- `raw/ingest-registry.md` — 11 entries added
- `index.md` — 1 source, 2 problems, 2 concepts, 1 decision added

Key patterns extracted:
1. **Feedback loop prevention**: Separate "what to compute" (mode) from "computed result" (value) — never let output be input trigger
2. **Paired partner architecture**: `pairedWith` for UI, `link_uuid` for backend — two separate linkage mechanisms
3. **Stateless preview**: Components displaying computed data should be controlled (no internal state)
4. **Fingerprint invalidation**: Hash material fields only — prevents unnecessary recalculation
5. **link_uuid promotion**: Decision based on target type needs, not source op type
6. **Post-flush WAC**: Compute on actual DB state in same transaction — eliminates adapter layer

## [2026-06-02] ingest | Batch 3 — Parallel Features (PWA, Port 60/40, Borsa Italiana, FX Fix)

Ingested 4 parallel-terminal features/fixes (no formal plan chains) @ anchor `84f8bd07`.

**Created** (1 source page):
- [[sources/r2-parallel-features-pwa-borsa-fx]] — Combined source covering PWA support (4 commits), Port 60/40 migration, Borsa Italiana provider, FX provider removal fix

**Created** (2 feature pages):
- [[features/F-098]] — NEW: Progressive Web App (PWA) — offline fallback, install button, iOS safe-area, theme-color sync
- [[features/F-099]] — NEW: Borsa Italiana Asset Provider — stocks, bonds, ETFs from borsaitaliana.it

**Created** (1 decision page):
- [[decisions/port-6040-scheme]] — All ports migrated from 8000/8001/8002 to 6040/6041/6042 ("60/40 rule" mnemonic)

**Updated**:
- [[features/registry]] — F-098 + F-099 added (Infrastructure / Assets domains)
- `raw/ingest-registry.md` — 5 entries added (PWA commits + plan, port commit, Borsa commit, FX fix commit)
- `index.md` — 2 feature pages, 1 source page, 1 decision added

Key observations:
1. **Provider pattern maturity**: Borsa Italiana is the 5th provider following `@register_provider` pattern — pattern now proven robust
2. **PWA = no-cache strategy**: financial apps prioritize data freshness over offline access — intentional design choice
3. **FX sentinel edge cases**: MANUAL auto-reinstate logic now handles all deletion scenarios including bulk-remove-all

## [2026-06-01] ingest | R2 Walktest Feedback Round — Batch 1 (WAC feature, 4 plans)

Ingested 4 source files from `PlanD_SplitPromoteFullStack/` R2 WAC sub-plans @ anchor `84f8bd07`.

**Created** (4 source pages):
- [[sources/r2-walktest-feedback-master]] — Master plan: 18 steps, 5 sub-plans (SP-A✅ SP-B✅ SP-C✅ SP-D⏳ SP-E🔲); cost_basis→Currency, WAC with FX, AssetEvent picker, store-first
- [[sources/r2-sp-a-cost-basis-wac]] — Backend: cost_basis_override→Currency, WACResult/WACConversionInfo schemas, compute_weighted_avg_cost with FX, recalc-wac endpoint (commit `92f4b1ba`)
- [[sources/r2-sp-b-backend-tests]] — Tests: 13 WAC API tests (WAC-1→WAC-13) + helpers; self-contained per-test isolation (commit `473d2611`)
- [[sources/r2-sp-c-bulkmodal-suggest-ux]] — Frontend: toolbar alignment, split preview fix, suggest overhaul (subtractive filter, human-readable, lightbulb), PromoteMergeModal simplified, ActionModal enhanced

**Created** (1 feature page):
- [[features/F-097]] — NEW: WAC — Weighted Average Cost (cross-currency, auto-calc on TRANSFER)

**Created** (1 decision page):
- [[decisions/cost-basis-currency-object]] — cost_basis_override from SafeDecimal to Currency {code, amount}; breaking change, no backward compat

**Updated**:
- [[features/F-048]] — 3 new status history entries (R2 SP-A/B/C), deferred items updated
- [[features/registry]] — F-097 added (fullstack, in-progress)
- `raw/ingest-registry.md` — 4 entries added
- `index.md` — F-097 in feature list, decision + 4 source pages added

Key architectural insights:
1. **Currency object over bare decimal**: unambiguous currency association enables multi-currency WAC
2. **Fail-safe WAC**: even one failed FX conversion → wac=None, never silently wrong
3. **Transient wac_info**: computed at commit time, not persisted — changes when FX rates update
4. **Target currency heuristic**: majority among TX → asset currency on tie → alphabetical

## [2026-05-31] ingest | Phase 07 Part 4 Round 6 — Plan D chain (7 files: split/promote full stack)

Ingested 8 source files: PlanB23 (registry backfill only, source page already existed), PlanD master @ `b0e223c0`, PlanD1 @ `666059b5`, PlanD2 @ `db7264ce`, D2-bugfix1 @ `fdf00d4b`, D2-bugfix2 @ `eb9b8ae2`, D2-bugfix3 @ `78f44497`, D2-bugfix4 @ `ce7344a1`.

**Created** (7 source pages):
- [[sources/phase07-part4-round6-pland-split-promote-master]] — Master plan: split/promote full stack integration into batch pipeline; D1✅ D2✅ bf1-4✅ D2-round2⏳; D3 absorbed into D2-bf3
- [[sources/phase07-part4-round6-pland1-backend-batch-suggest]] — Backend: TXMixedBatch + splits[]/promotes[], endpoint elimination (DD2), promote-suggest, consumed_link_uuids (DD4), _PromoteCandidate, 18 tests
- [[sources/phase07-part4-round6-pland2-frontend-split-promote]] — Frontend: PromoteMergeModal 3-column diff, BulkModal split/promote actions, Main Table promote migration to batch, suggest green banner
- [[sources/phase07-part4-round6-pland2-bugfix1]] — 21 bugs: BulkModal first-open race (getTypeRule FALLBACK_RULE), promote toolbar not appearing, findPromoteMatch constraint enrichment, collapse post-promote
- [[sources/phase07-part4-round6-pland2-bugfix2]] — Split preview editability (corrects DD-BF1), pipeline reorder (splits before updates), TXBatchResultItem.id→ids[], payload fixes
- [[sources/phase07-part4-round6-pland2-bugfix3]] — Biggest round: split schema {id_a,id_b}, suggest banner redesign, E2E (absorbed D3 scope), TransactionActionModal unification, cash sign fix
- [[sources/phase07-part4-round6-pland2-bugfix4]] — PMC auto-calc (compute_weighted_avg_cost), cost_basis_override only on receiver, promote-suggest constraint fix (None amount/qty), link_uuid sync, delta-days slider

**Updated** (1 decision):
- [[decisions/cash-transfer-split-promote]] — MAJOR: standalone `/split` and `/promote` endpoints eliminated (DD2); split/promote now exclusively via batch pipeline `splits[]+promotes[]`; added promote-suggest, consumed_link_uuids, PMC auto-calc

**Updated** (3 feature/connection pages):
- [[features/F-048]] — title updated (now "Form / Bulk / Delete / Promote / Split"), layer changed to fullstack, 8 new status history entries (D1→D2→bf1→bf2→bf3→bf4), PromoteMergeModal section, Split/Promote in BulkModal section, PMC Auto-Calc section, 10 new source files
- [[features/registry]] — F-048 title + layer updated
- [[connections/transactions-connections]] — header updated with Plan D completion status

**Registry**: 8 entries added to `raw/ingest-registry.md` (PlanB23 as `uncommitted` backfill, 7 PlanD files with commit hashes)
**Index**: 7 source pages + 1 decision summary updated in `index.md`

Key architectural insights documented:
1. **Endpoint elimination** (DD2): `/split` and `/promote` never used in production → removed entirely. All mutations go through unified `execute_batch` pipeline.
2. **consumed_link_uuids** (DD4): prevents Step 6 link resolution from re-processing link_uuids already consumed by promotes in Step 5c. Critical for atomic batch promote-and-create flows.
3. **Pipeline reorder** (DD-R2.2): `deletes(3) → splits(3b) → updates(4) → creates(5) → promotes(5c) → links(6) → balance(7)` — splits before updates enables "split + edit post-split" in same batch.
4. **PMC auto-calc**: `compute_weighted_avg_cost()` auto-fills `cost_basis_override` on TRANSFER receiver when null. Weighted average of BUY prices + incoming TRANSFER cost_basis at source broker.
5. **D3 absorbed**: E2E test scope originally planned as separate D3 sub-plan was absorbed into D2-bugfix3.

## [2026-05-30] ingest | Phase 07 Part 4 Round 6 Plans C2 + C2R2 — Bugfix, Pair Validation, MockFX, Contextual Validate

Ingested 2 new plan files (C2 @ `6aac0dce`, C2R2 @ `f9f3bec2`). Verified 8 already-ingested plans from the same batch — no re-ingest needed; existing pages accurate.

**Created** (2 source pages):
- [[sources/phase07-part4-round6-planc2-bugfix-pair-validation]] — 6 bugs fixed, pair desc/tags validation, clone paired, picker hideActions, bulk toast, UC 58%→92%, Docker non-root, font self-hosted, FX fallback, classification race
- [[sources/phase07-part4-round6-planc2r2-regressions-mockfx]] — MockFX providers, auto-populate removal, DistributionEditor fix, contextual validate, end-of-day balance confirmation, 8 balance walk tests, 3 FX fallback tests, 3 asset classification E2E

**Created** (4 decisions):
- [[decisions/pair-description-tags-validation]] — linked pairs must have identical desc+tags
- [[decisions/auto-populate-removal]] — metadata flow frontend-driven (probe→diff→PATCH)
- [[decisions/formmodal-contextual-validate]] — FormModal sends entire bulk context to /validate
- [[decisions/end-of-day-balance-check]] — intra-day order irrelevant, end-of-day aggregation

**Created** (1 problem):
- [[problems/fx-multi-route-no-fallback]] — FX sync used only primary route, no fallback to ECB/FED/SNB

**Updated**:
- [[features/F-048]] — Plan C2/C2R2 entries in status history, contextual validate, clone paired, picker hideActions, bulk toast, balance walk, 4 new related_decisions
- index.md, raw/ingest-registry.md

**Verification of already-ingested plans** (8 files): All source pages for Round 6 ContextMenu, Plan A, Plan B, Plan B1, Plan B23, Plan B23 Appendix, Plan C, Plan C3 confirmed accurate with no contradictions. Plan C3 page verified — no updates needed (correctly documents PendingOp as successor to C2R2 work).

Key architectural progression documented: C2 (bugfix + pair validation + infrastructure) → C2R2 (MockFX + auto-populate removal + contextual validate + balance confirmation) → C3 (PendingOp tagged union).

## [2026-05-30] ingest | Phase 07 Part 4 Round 6 Plan C3 — PendingOp Refactor
Ingested from `RoadmapV4_UI/phases/phase-07-subplan/Parte4/Round6/plan-phase07-transaction-Part4_Round6_PlanC3_PendingOpRefactor.prompt.md`.
**Created**: [[sources/phase07-part4-round6-planc3-pendingop-refactor]], [[decisions/pendingop-tagged-union]].
**Updated**: [[features/F-048]] (PendingOp tagged union, factory functions, 3 new E2E tests, data-action-id), [[concepts/txstore-pattern]] (PendingOp model updated to final implementation), [[concepts/e2e-data-testid-rule]] (data-action-id pattern).
Key insight: DraftRow→PendingOp completes 80%→100% of txStore architecture. Zero-copy originals + tagged discriminator + derived status make Plan D (Split/Promote) trivial (~10 LOC per action). `data-action-id` establishes i18n-resilient E2E selectors for DataTable row actions.

## [2026-05-29] ingest | Phase 07 Part 4 Round 6 Plan C — txStore Refactor
Ingested from `RoadmapV4_UI/phases/phase-07-subplan/Parte4/Round6/plan-phase07-transaction-Part4_Round6_PlanC_TxStoreRefactor.prompt.md`.
**Created**: [[sources/phase07-part4-round6-planc-txstore-refactor]], [[concepts/txstore-pattern]], [[decisions/txstore-single-source-of-truth]].
**Updated**: [[features/F-048]] (txStore as single source of truth, WorkspaceIntent pattern, PendingOp model, interface deduplication in types.ts, -30% LOC).
Key insight: 5 recurring bug categories (17+ instances) all rooted in 3-copy prop cascade; eliminated structurally by centralized store. Piano D (Split/Promote) now trivial.

## [2026-05-29] ingest | Phase 07 Part 4 Round 6 Plan B23 Appendix 1 — UI Polish
Ingested from `RoadmapV4_UI/phases/phase-07-subplan/Parte4/Round6/plan-phase07-transaction-Part4_Round6_PlanB23_Appendix1_UIPolish.prompt.md`.
**Created**: [[sources/phase07-part4-round6-planb23-appendix1-ui-polish]].
**Updated**: [[features/F-048]] (structured delete toast, responsive footer buttons, row background tints, viewer-only guard on bulk actions, conditional "Reset all", "Reset selected" toolbar button).
Note: Execution order in master plan updated — old Piano C (Split/Promote) renamed Piano D; txStore refactor inserted as Piano C prerequisite.

## [2026-05-27] ingest | Phase 07 Part 4 Round 6 Plan B23 — Bulk Delete via BulkModal + Mode Removal
Ingested Plan B23 + 3 source files (TransactionBulkModal.svelte, TransactionDeleteModal.svelte, +page.svelte transactions).
**Created**: [[sources/phase07-part4-round6-planb23-bulk-delete]], [[decisions/bulkmodal-mode-removal]].
**Updated**: [[features/F-048]] (mode-less architecture, delete flow, enriched DeleteModal, PickerModal guard),
[[features/F-047]] (BulkDeleteLinkedPairModal removed, bulkMode state removed),
[[connections/transactions-connections]] (Round 6 status), [[domains/transactions]],
[[features/registry]] (F-048 title), index.md.
Key changes: (1) BulkDeleteLinkedPairModal eliminated — bulk delete now via BulkModal with `initialStatus:'delete'`;
(2) `mode` prop removed from BulkModal — now mode-less, each row infers create/edit from `tx.id > 0`;
(3) TransactionDeleteModal enriched: 3 layouts, validate-now, error banners with resolveIssueMessage, success toast with icons;
(4) PickerModal guard for non-editable rows; (5) Confirm edit on deleted row.

## [2026-05-27] query | AssetMatchingWizard / asset search / Phase 6 Step 5 status
Synthesized answer from: F-028, F-049, F-012, domains/assets, workflows/brim-import-flow, workflows/asset-onboarding-flow, connections/assets-connections, sources/phase06-step3-rounds, phase-06-assets.md plan.
**Key finding**: AssetMatchingWizard.svelte was never built — Phase 6 Step 5 is still ⏳. The component exists only in plans and wiki references but has zero source files in the codebase. AssetSearchAutocomplete.svelte (F-028) exists and works for asset creation, but the 3-step matching wizard (DB search → provider search → manual create) for BRIM import was interrupted before Phase 07 Part 4 bugfix rounds.

## [2026-05-26] file | SafeDecimal — Preventing Scientific Notation in JSON Responses
Filed [[concepts/safe-decimal-pattern]]. `SafeDecimal` is an `Annotated[Decimal, PlainSerializer]`
type that forces `format(v, 'f')` during JSON serialization, preventing Python's `str(Decimal)`
from emitting scientific notation (`"1.29E+5"`) which breaks frontend Zod validators.
3-layer approach: type definition in `common.py`, `Currency.amount` adoption, per-schema migration.
Incrementally adopted in brokers.py + transactions.py; prices.py/fx.py/brim.py still pending.
Updated: index.md.

## [2026-05-26] file | Static export of constant metadata at compile-time (deferred)
Filed [[decisions/static-metadata-export]]. Deferred to Phase 8+: extracting constant
metadata (TX_TYPE_METADATA, asset types, currency codes) as static JSON at `dev.py api sync`
time instead of serving via runtime endpoints. Current cost is 1 req/session — not worth
the sync-pipeline + store refactor effort until more constant-data endpoints accumulate.
Related: [[decisions/server-driven-type-rules]].

## [2026-04-25] lint | wiki-lint pass #5 — post Phase 7 Parts 1+2+3 ingest reconciliation

**Scope**: full health-check after Phase 7 Part 3 closure (backend coverage 87.06%,
2 production bugs filed, Policy D destructive wipe in place, new backup router,
ErasableNumberCell typing fix). Workspace HEAD = `a61b0dfa` (matches latest re-anchor
in `raw/ingest-registry.md`).

### Drift detection — ✅ clean

All 17 unique git-hashes in `raw/ingest-registry.md` resolve in current history.
Phase 7 sources (Parts 1/2/3 + Closure + Closure_2) re-anchored at `a61b0dfa` =
HEAD; `git diff a61b0dfa HEAD -- {phase07 paths} = 0 lines`. No source drift.

| L5-01 | P0 | `connections/transactions-connections.md` | Header "Phase 7 — in progress (Part 1✅, Part 2✅, Part 3–5 TODO)" + 7-row gap table all stale; Parts 1–3 now ✅ DONE | rewrote header + replaced gap table with closed-gap table |
| L5-02 | P0 | `features/F-051.md` | Source files & layer breakdown referenced `Transaction.related_asset_event_id`; **code has `Transaction.asset_event_id`** (models.py L580/L659) | renamed all references to `asset_event_id`; updated status to `implemented`; added Policy D link |
| L5-03 | P0 | `domains/transactions.md` | F-051 row "planned"; "Known problems" still listed Phase 7 gaps as open (access control, multi-broker atomic, plugin_version) — all closed in Part 2/3 | updated F-051 row→`implemented`, rewrote "Known problems" to reflect closed gaps + add Policy D context |
| L5-04 | P1 | `problems/assets-wipe-error-attr-mismatch.md` | Reported 2 fixed sites; **a third sibling `e.code` reference still lives at `assets.py:976` (bulk_upsert_events)** — code wins → annotate as residual | added "Residual occurrence" section; flagged for code-side follow-up |
| L5-05 | P1 | `decisions/policy-d-currency-wipe.md` | Missing cross-ref to `features/F-073` (Backup & Restore) — backup endpoints belong to F-073 | added `F-073` to `related` + body |
| L5-06 | P1 | `entities/backup-router.md` | Missing cross-ref to `features/F-073` | added F-073 in `related` + body |
| L5-07 | P1 | `features/F-073.md` | No `related_decisions`/`related_problems`; doesn't mention Policy D or `entities/backup-router` | added related_decisions + cross-refs |
| L5-08 | P1 | `decisions/price-currency-hard-reject.md` | I.3 (409 on currency change with prices) doesn't link to its destructive successor Policy D | added "When the user accepts the 409" pointer + `related: policy-d-currency-wipe` |
| L5-09 | P1 | `problems/asset-currency-mismatch.md` | Older "per-row currency column" page — silent on the fact that I.2 hard-reject + Policy D now formalise a stricter model on top of it | added "Superseded-in-spirit" header + cross-refs to I.2/I.3/Policy D |
| L5-10 | P1 | `domains/assets.md` | No mention of Policy D destructive wipe or backup-router despite being the asset domain owner | added "Asset currency change (Policy D)" subsection + cross-refs |
| L5-11 | P2 | `wiki/features/F-049.md`, `F-047.md`, `F-046.md` | mostly current; only minor stale gap-analysis bullets — covered transitively by L5-01 / L5-03 | none (P2, deferred) |

### Index drift

`index.md` Problems/Decisions/Entities tables reflect the on-disk state correctly
post Phase 7 Part 3 ingest. F-051 status row was the only case where index
implicitly inherited the page's stale `in-progress` — now reconciled via L5-02.

### Orphan detection — ✅ none

Every wiki/* page is reachable from `index.md` directly or transitively
(domains → features → connections → decisions/concepts/problems). The 4 new
Phase-7 pages (`problems/assets-wipe-error-attr-mismatch`, `problems/babel-currency-symbol-echo`,
`decisions/policy-d-currency-wipe`, `entities/backup-router`) are all listed in
`index.md` and now also linked from at least 2 sibling pages each (post-L5).

### Contradiction scan — beyond fixes above

- `e.code` vs `e.error_code`: only the wiki had stale claims; current code
  uses `e.error_code` in the 2 wipe handlers. Residual `e.code` at line 976
  (bulk_upsert_events) is a **code-side latent bug** — annotated, not silently
  preserved (L5-04).
- "Soft-skip currency mismatch" appears nowhere in the wiki as the *current*
  behaviour — only as historical context inside `price-currency-hard-reject.md`
  and Part 3 source page (correctly framed as "old behaviour").

### Knowledge condensation

- Pages **rewritten in place**: 5 (transactions-connections, F-051, domains/transactions, asset-currency-mismatch, price-currency-hard-reject)
- Cross-ref additions: 6 pages received new `related:` + body links
- Sections added: 4 ("Residual occurrence", "Asset currency change (Policy D)" in domains/assets, "Superseded-in-spirit" in asset-currency-mismatch, "Closed Phase 7 gaps" in transactions-connections)
- Sections deleted: 1 (the now-misleading "Phase 7 Gap Analysis (from plan)" 7-row TODO table in transactions-connections)
- Pages deleted: 0 (all stale content was condensed/annotated, not removed — historical signal preserved with "Superseded" framing)
- Concept debt scanned: `editbuffer-pattern` (concept) + `data-editor-unification` (decision) overlap is intentional (mechanism vs rationale). FX-related concepts (`daily-point-policy`, `prices-current-side-effect`) and BRIM-related decisions (`brim-broker-scoped`, `brim-fake-asset-id`, `brim-parser-only`) cover distinct angles; no merges performed.

**Total touched**: 11 wiki pages + log.md + this entry. **0 new pages created**, **0 pages deleted**.

## [2026-04-24] lint | Lint pass #4 — Phase 07 contradictions + API URL audit

**Issues found**: 7 (4 high, 3 medium)
**Issues repaired**: 7

### 🔴 High — Repaired

1. **Contradiction**: `wiki/domains/transactions.md` said `POST /brokers/:id/transactions/bulk` and "atomic per broker / per-broker scoped" on 4 different lines. Real code (`tx_router = APIRouter(prefix="/transactions")`) has `POST /transactions/bulk` (multi-broker atomic). Fixed all 4 occurrences: prose, Mermaid node, Mermaid node label ("per-broker scoped"), key-decisions bullet. Also removed the ⚠️ "under active development" warning banner (F-046 is now implemented) and updated F-046 row status to `implemented`.

2. **Wrong API URLs**: `wiki/workflows/brim-import-flow.md` upload, list-files, and parse endpoints still referenced the old `/files/` router prefix. Real code: `brim_router = APIRouter(prefix="/import")` mounted under `broker_router(prefix="/brokers")`. Fixed: `POST /api/v1/brokers/import/upload?broker_id={id}`, `GET /api/v1/brokers/import/files?broker_ids={id}`, `POST /api/v1/brokers/import/files/{id}/parse`. Also corrected source-files reference from non-existent `files.py` to `brokers.py (brim_router)`.

3. **Missing file**: `wiki/sources/phase07-transactions.md` was indexed in `index.md` and `raw/ingest-registry.md` (hash `f17d963`) but the file did not exist (zombie entry from previous session). Created the source page from `plan-phase07-transaction-Part1.md`.

4. **Wrong enables**: `wiki/features/F-046.md` incorrectly listed `F-037` (Signal Library Framework) in `enables`. Signal Library depends on the asset detail chart area (F-033), not on the TX Bulk API. Removed F-037 from F-046 enables.

### 🟡 Medium — Repaired

5. **Malformed YAML + wrong cross-ref**: `wiki/features/F-037.md` had `depends_on: [F-046-area: PriceChartFull]` — invalid YAML (colon in value) and wrong F-code (F-046 is TX API, not a chart). Fixed to `depends_on: [F-033]` (Asset Detail Page chart/signals/editor is the actual dependency).

6. **Missing cross-ref**: `wiki/decisions/brim-parser-only.md` had no link to `[[decisions/brim-fake-asset-id]]`. Added a "Related decisions" section explaining that fake IDs are the mechanism that makes parser-only viable.

**Deferred (no action needed)**:
- `problems/asset-currency-mismatch.md` — already status `resolved`, no further action.
- F-047/F-048/F-049/F-050/F-051 status in transactions domain — Phase 7 is still in-progress for these features; left as-is.

## [2026-04-24] ingest | Created 11 domain cluster pages

**Pages created** (`wiki/domains/`):
- `auth.md` — Domain: AUTH (F-001–F-003)

## [2026-04-24] ingest | knowledge_base 03, 06, 07, 08

**Sources**: `knowledge_base/03_documentation.md`, `knowledge_base/06_testing_backend.md`, `knowledge_base/07_testing_frontend.md`, `knowledge_base/08_i18n_duplicates.md` — all @ git:`e8ab12a`.

### Created source pages

- [[sources/kb-06-testing-backend]] — Backend pytest architecture, _TestingServerManager, coverage, provider filtering
- [[sources/kb-07-testing-frontend]] — Playwright E2E patterns, fixtures, backend coverage SIGTERM architecture
- [[sources/kb-08-i18n-duplicates]] — i18n key rationalization principle, 42 duplicate groups

### Created concept pages
- [[concepts/mkdocs-suffix-i18n]] — Suffix strategy (`.en.md`, `.it.md`) for multilingual docs, ~36 source → 108 translated files
- [[concepts/backend-test-isolation]] — Each test creates own user via `unique_id()`, zero cross-test state
- [[concepts/e2e-data-testid-rule]] — ALWAYS use `data-testid`, NEVER CSS classes or text (i18n-safe, refactor-safe)

### Created decision page

- `log.md`: this entry

## [2026-04-24] ingest | KB 01/02 backend+frontend, Phase06 Bugfix Steps 1/2/6

Ingested 7 source documents from Phase 06 development:

**Knowledge Base References**:
- `knowledge_base/01_backend.md` → [[sources/kb-01-backend]] — backend architecture overview
- `knowledge_base/02_frontend.md` → [[sources/kb-02-frontend]] — frontend architecture overview

**Phase 06 Plans**:
- Phase 06 Bugfix Migration Steps 1-3 → [[sources/phase06-bugfix-migration]]
- Phase 06 Step 2 Providers → [[sources/phase06-step2-providers]]  
- Phase 06 Step 2c Sync Refactor → [[sources/phase06-step2c-sync-refactor]]
- Phase 06 Step 6 i18n Polish → [[sources/phase06-step6-i18n-polish]]

**New Decisions Created**:
- [[decisions/three-phase-pipeline]] — PREPARE→FETCH→PERSIST pattern for bulk operations (fixes concurrent session commits)

**New Concepts Created**:
- [[concepts/responsive-4mode-layout]] — 4-breakpoint system (wide/tablet/tablet-s/mobile) for filter bar pages

**New Problems Documented**:
- [[problems/asset-sync-transaction-closed]] — SQLAlchemy concurrent commit error, resolved by 3-phase pipeline

**Key Insights**:
- 3-phase pipeline pattern is a **documented convention**, not a base class abstraction (FX and Asset implementations differ significantly)
- `tablet-s` breakpoint (500-770px) provides better UX for intermediate screen widths where neither tablet nor mobile layouts work well
- i18n duplicate consolidation reduced 18 groups (conservative approach, ~30 intentional duplicates preserved per context-aware rationalization principle)
- CSS Scraper and Scheduled Investment providers use `params_schema` for dynamic form generation
- SyncModalBase pattern extracted common sync modal logic (FX + Asset wrappers)
- TypeScript fixes: `getUserStorage` return type, `EditableNumberCell` min/max, lucide-svelte icon type compatibility

**Files enriched**: No existing feature/decision pages needed updates (all major patterns already documented).

**Registry updates**: Added 1 decision, 1 concept, 1 problem, 7 source pages.

## [2026-04-24] ingest | TODO_FUTURI re-ingest + mkdocs developer pages mapping

**Task 1 — Re-ingest TODO_FUTURI.md**

Source: `TODO_FUTURI.md` @ git:`fcdd89e` (2026-04-17)

Comparison with existing registry F-075–F-095: all 21 features already documented from previous ingest (2026-05-10). Detected 1 NEW feature not yet in registry:

- **F-096** Scheduled Investment — Decoupled Frequencies (price vs coupon) + Anchor Day

**Created**:
- [[features/F-096]] — idea status, extends [[features/F-034]]

**Updated**:
- [[features/registry]] — added F-096 row, updated statistics (96 total features, 22 planned/idea)
- [[sources/todos]] — added F-096 to table

**Task 2 — Map mkdocs developer pages to features**

Systematically read all 68 mkdocs developer pages and mapped them to 36 features. Mapping hypothesis:

- **Architecture**: patterns (registry, async, alembic, config, plugin guides) → F-006, F-012, F-015, F-025, F-059, F-064
- **Database**: schema pages → F-001, F-002, F-009, F-016, F-030, F-046, F-064
- **Backend**: FX/Assets/BRIM architecture → F-012, F-013, F-015, F-016, F-017, F-018, F-019, F-024, F-025, F-026, F-027, F-031, F-034, F-035
- **API**: overview and testing → F-068
- **Frontend**: styling, i18n, state, components → F-001, F-004, F-005, F-008, F-009, F-011, F-020, F-071, F-072
- **Testing**: walkthrough pages → F-067, F-068
- **Docs/Tools**: translation pipeline, dev setup → F-063, F-070

**Updated 36 feature pages**:
- Frontmatter `mkdocs:` field — changed from `null` to primary mkdocs path (e.g., `"developer/backend/fx/architecture.md"`)
- `## Source files` table — prepended mkdocs rows (Primary mkdocs + secondary mkdocs pages for each feature)

**Coverage**:
- F-001, F-002, F-003, F-004, F-005, F-006, F-008, F-009, F-011, F-012, F-013

- `developer/frontend/index.md`, `pages/index.md`, `components/index.md`, `components/data-table.md`, `components/live-ticker.md`, `components/select.md`
- `developer/frontend/components/ui-base/{atoms,datePickers,feedback,modals}.md`

**Registry summary after update**:
- 96 total features
- 62 implemented/documented
- 3 in-progress
- 31 planned/idea
- **36 features now linked to mkdocs developer pages** (up from 0 before this session)

## [2026-04-24] lint | Full reasoned lint pass #3

**Checks run**: thin pages, missing source sections, broken wikilinks, F-096 symmetry, registry vs files, mkdocs path validity, index orphans, log format, conceptual quality, connections currency.

**Issues found and fixed**:
- ✅ F-075–F-096: added full "Domain: PLANNED/IDEA" section to `registry.md` (22 features were counted in stats but had no individual rows)
- ✅ F-034 `enables:` updated to include F-096
- ✅ `## Source files` added to `problems/sync-functions-dead-code.md`, `problems/tanstack-svelte5-incompatibility.md`, `sources/todos.md`

**No issues found**:
- No broken wikilinks
- No orphan pages (all reachable from index.md)
- All mkdocs: paths point to real files
- Log format: all entries well-formed
- Thin pages: all under-25-line pages are planned/idea features (appropriate)
- Concept pages (daily-point-policy, backend-only-calculations, fifo-runtime-decision): substantive and accurate
## [2026-04-24] file | I-bis #24 v4 — `/prices/current` has a persistence side-effect
Filed lesson learned from final iteration of I-bis #24 (Auto-refresh mirato post-sync).
Root cause: `AssetSourceManager.get_current_prices_bulk` upserts today's OHLC to
PriceHistory (F.2 + F.3), so chaining `/current` + `/sync` for the same asset always
yields empty `changed_points` — the changes already happened on `/current`.
Created: [[concepts/prices-current-side-effect]] (cross-cutting API contract),
[[problems/prices-current-sync-chain-empty-delta]] (specific anti-pattern bug).
Updated: index.md (Concepts + Problems tables).

## 2026-04-24 — Phase 07 Part 2–3 Ingest (Transactions system final)

Ingested all remaining Phase 07 plan files (Part 2, Part 3, Closure, Closure_2 + BlockG).
This completes the documentation of the core transaction system architecture.

**Sources ingested (4 new source pages):**
- [[sources/phase07-part2-brim-revision]] — BRIM Revision 2 (parser-only)
- [[sources/phase07-part3-api-consolidation]] — multi-broker atomic TX, transfer semantics, currency simplification
- [[sources/phase07-part3-closure]] — Blocco I decisions, I-bis queue, #R6-4 scheduled investment wipe
- [[sources/phase07-part3-closure2]] — Batch 4 (saveWithRetry adoption), BlockG test coverage (76.05%)

**Decisions created (4):**
- [[decisions/brim-parser-only]] — BRIM is a parser; no commit endpoint, no asset events
- [[decisions/multi-broker-atomic-tx]] — bulk endpoints not broker-scoped, multi-broker atomic
- [[decisions/tx-link-uuid-semantics]] — TRANSFER/DEPOSIT/WITHDRAWAL link_uuid rules + promote endpoint
- [[decisions/price-currency-hard-reject]] — hard 400 on mismatch, 409 on currency change with prices

**Concepts created (1):**
- [[concepts/savewithretry-frontend-pattern]] — unified modal save helper adopted in 8+ modals

**Features updated:**
- [[features/F-012]] — BRIM Revision 2: parser-only, plugin_version, parse_is_stale, bulk_upsert_events rename
- [[features/F-046]] — status→implemented, multi-broker bulk endpoints, validate/suggest/promote
- [[features/F-049]] — commit via /transactions/bulk (not BRIM-specific), parse_is_stale UI
- [[features/F-051]] — status→in-progress, events/suggest endpoint documented

**Registry updated:**
- F-046: `in-progress` → `implemented`
- F-051: `planned` → `in-progress`

**Wiki page count**: ~176 pages (170 + 4 sources + 4 decisions + 1 concept - 3 from prev pass)

## [2026-04-25] ingest | phase07 Parts 1/2/3 — re-anchor + G-batch6/G-batch7 closure

Re-ingested Phase 7 Parts 1, 2, 3 (incl. Closure + Closure_2 + Batch4d + BlockG)
after the plans were archived from `RoadmapV4_UI/plan-phase07-transaction-Part*.md`
into `RoadmapV4_UI/phases/phase-07-subplan/Parte{1,2,3}/`. All Phase 7 Parts 1–3
are now ✅ DONE.

**Re-anchored sources** (path + git_hash → `a61b0dfa`, status → ✅ DONE):
- [[sources/phase07-transactions]] — Parte1/Part1.md
- [[sources/phase07-part2-brim-revision]] — Parte2/Part2.prompt.md
- [[sources/phase07-part3-api-consolidation]] — Parte3/Part3.md
- [[sources/phase07-part3-closure]] — Parte3/Part3_1_Closure.md
- [[sources/phase07-part3-closure2]] — Parte3/Part3_1_Closure_2.prompt.md (+ 3 companions)

**Delta surfaced** (new content not in previous ingest):
- Backend coverage **76.05% → 85.34% → 87.06%** in 2 days (G-batch6 + G-batch7); from ~57% at start of Phase 7
- 2 production bugs discovered by the new tests:
  - [[problems/assets-wipe-error-attr-mismatch]] — `e.code` → `e.error_code` (HTTP 500 → 404)
  - [[problems/babel-currency-symbol-echo]] — `normalize_currency` echoed garbage; strict pycountry lookup
- Policy D destructive wipe semantics formalised (commit `8fc018ab`):
  - [[decisions/policy-d-currency-wipe]] — created
  - Distinguishes from `#R6-4` selective wipe (manual events preserved there)
- New backup router `/api/v1/backup`:
  - [[entities/backup-router]] — created
  - Endpoints: `/backup/asset/{id}/{prices,events}` + `/backup/fx/{base}/{quote}/rates`
  - Replaces legacy `/assets/{id}/prices/export`
- I-bis #24 `changed_points` cap-500 + live-poll merge (commit `ddb1fcfb`) — refined in [[sources/phase07-part3-closure2]]
- ErasableNumberCell `$state<number | null>` fix (commit `83328b6b`) — captured in closure_2

**Files corrected** (previous ingest had wrong info):
- [[sources/phase07-part3-closure]] — old "R3-3 Policy D" line incorrectly claimed
  `/api/v1/system/{export,import}` as the backup. Replaced with the actual `backup.py`
  router + Policy D destructive wipe description.

**Cross-links added/strengthened**: F-012 (BRIM), F-046 (TX bulk), F-051 (TX↔AssetEvent),
F-056 (FIFO runtime — transaction preservation rationale), F-019/F-020 (FX),
[[entities/db-models]], [[entities/api-router]],
[[concepts/savewithretry-frontend-pattern]], [[decisions/price-currency-hard-reject]].

**Pages created**: 2 problems + 1 decision + 1 entity = 4 new wiki pages.
**Pages updated**: 5 source pages + index.md + ingest-registry.md.

## [2026-04-28] ingest | Phase 07 Part 4 — /transactions UI + Round 1 + Round 2

Sources:
- `plan-phase07-transaction-Part4.prompt.md` @ git:`dcb91929`
- `plan-phase07-transaction-Part4_Round1-tableRefactorBugfix.prompt.md` @ git:`444b2d16`
- `plan-phase07-transaction-Part4_Round2-tableRefactorBugfix.prompt.md` @ git:`29898623`

Phase 7 Part 4 completes the `/transactions` frontend page (F-047 → **implemented**). Round 1 fixed 82+ issues across 14 sub-rounds, establishing 100% client-side filtering (W28 decision). Round 2 introduced `createEntityStore<T>()` factory, `brokerStore`, conditional pair-grouping, per-currency sliders, and `TxTypeIconCell`. F-048 Staging Modal moved from `planned` → **in-progress** (manual `create-many`/`edit-many` done; BRIM mode deferred to Part 5). Critical deviation: original plan had server-side filters on `GET /transactions` → replaced by full client-side filtering; `highlight_id` URL param removed in favour of DOM-direct pulse animation.

**Created**:
- [[sources/phase07-part4-transactions-ui]]
- [[sources/phase07-part4-round1]]
- [[sources/phase07-part4-round2]]
- [[concepts/entity-store-pattern]]
- [[concepts/always-pair-adjacent]]
- [[concepts/opportunistic-cache-merge]]
- [[decisions/transactions-client-side-filtering]]
- [[decisions/datatable-tooltip-custom-cell]]
- [[problems/svelte5-effect-read-write-loop]]
- [[problems/babel-currency-symbol-locale]]
- [[problems/datatable-filter-options-disappear]]

**Updated**:
- [[features/F-047]] (in-progress → implemented, full component inventory)
- [[features/F-048]] (planned → in-progress, manual mode done)
- [[features/registry]] (F-047/F-048 status rows)
- [[domains/transactions]] (F-047/F-048 status, Part 4 context)
- [[connections/transactions-connections]] (header + gap table Part 4 closure)
- index.md, ingest-registry.md

**Pages created**: 3 sources + 3 concepts + 2 decisions + 3 problems = 11 new wiki pages.
**Pages updated**: 5 existing pages + index.md + ingest-registry.md.

## [2026-04-28] lint | Wiki lint pass #6 — post Phase 07 Part 4 ingest

**Scope**: health check after Phase 7 Part 4 ingest (11 new pages, 7 updated). Focus: stale endpoint references, F-047/F-048 status drift, orphan pages, index drift.

**Issues found**: 4 (1 high, 2 medium, 1 low)
**Issues repaired**: 3 (1 high, 2 medium)
**Deferred**: 1 (low)

### 🔴 High — Repaired

| # | Page | Problem | Fix |
|---|------|---------|-----|
| L6-01 | `domains/brokers.md` (Mermaid line 47) | `POST /brokers/:id/transactions/bulk` in Mermaid diagram — **stale broker-scoped endpoint**. Actual endpoint since Phase 7 Part 3 is `POST /transactions/bulk` (multi-broker atomic). This was fixed in `domains/transactions.md` in Lint #4 but the Brokers domain Mermaid was missed. | Replaced with `POST /transactions/bulk` |

### 🟡 Medium — Repaired

| # | Page | Problem | Fix |
|---|------|---------|-----|
| L6-02 | `domains/brokers.md` "What comes next" | Described F-048 Staging Modal as entirely future work — stale after Phase 7 Part 4 delivered manual `create-many`/`edit-many` modes | Updated to note manual modes done, BRIM `create-brim` coming in Part 5 |
| L6-03 | `raw/ingest-registry.md` Round1 entry | `plan-phase07-transaction-Part4_Round1` shows 14-line drift at git `444b2d16`. The diff is trivial: successor link updated from planned placeholder name to actual Round2 filename. Content is accurate; the drift is purely metadata. | Annotated in source page (`phase07-part4-round1.md`) — no re-ingest needed |

### 🟢 Low — Deferred

| # | Page | Problem | Recommendation |
|---|------|---------|---------------|
| L6-04 | `features/F-049.md` | F-049 describes "Review staging" in the flow; doesn't mention that F-048 manual mode is now available as an alternative entry to staging for non-BRIM use | P2 — update F-049 in Phase 7 Part 5 when BRIM→staging flow is finalized |

### Drift detection summary

| Source | Hash | Lines changed | Assessment |
|--------|------|---------------|------------|
| `plan-phase07-transaction-Part4.prompt.md` | `dcb91929` | 0 | ✅ clean |
| `plan-phase07-transaction-Part4_Round1-tableRefactorBugfix.prompt.md` | `444b2d16` | 14 | ⚠️ trivial — successor link metadata only |
| `plan-phase07-transaction-Part4_Round2-tableRefactorBugfix.prompt.md` | `29898623` | 0 | ✅ clean |

### Orphan check — ✅ none

All 11 new pages have inbound `[[links]]` from at least 2 other wiki files each (F-047, source pages, index.md, log.md, domain pages). No orphans.

### Index drift — ✅ none

No wiki pages missing from index.md (except individual F-00X feature pages, which are intentionally not individually listed — only notable ones appear under "Individual Feature Pages"). No dead index references found.

### Concept debt — ✅ satisfied by new pages

Terms that appeared 7–18× across wiki pages before this ingest now have concept pages:
- `entity-store-pattern` (18 occurrences) → [[concepts/entity-store-pattern]] ✅
- `always-pair-adjacent` (16 occurrences) → [[concepts/always-pair-adjacent]] ✅
- `opportunistic-cache-merge` (7 occurrences) → [[concepts/opportunistic-cache-merge]] ✅

`TxTypeIconCell` (6 occurrences) is a component name, not a pattern — documented in F-047. No concept page needed.

**Total touched**: `domains/brokers.md` (2 fixes) + log.md. **0 new pages created**, **0 pages deleted**.

## [2026-04-28] correction | Source-verified fixes — 4 factual errors corrected

Cross-checking all Phase 7 Part 4 wiki pages against actual source files (range: `fcdd89e8` → `2989862` HEAD). 4 factual errors corrected:

1. **`TxTypeIconCell.svelte` path** (F-047.md, sources/phase07-part4-round2.md): Missing `cells/` subdirectory. Fixed to `frontend/src/lib/components/transactions/cells/TxTypeIconCell.svelte`.

2. **TxTypeIconCell desktop interaction** (sources/phase07-part4-round2.md): Claimed "single click → open doc". Actual code: **double-click** (`ondblclick`) opens doc; single click shows tooltip only.

3. **assetStore loader endpoint** (concepts/entity-store-pattern.md, concepts/opportunistic-cache-merge.md): Examples used `apiClient.get('/assets/all')`. Actual: `zodiosApi.list_assets_api_v1_assets_query_get()` → `GET /assets/query`.

4. **Babel fix code** (problems/babel-currency-symbol-locale.md): Function signature was `list_currencies(locale: str)` (wrong). Actual: `list_currencies(language: str = "en")`. Code used `locale='en'` string; actual code uses `en_locale = get_babel_locale("en")` (a `babel.Locale` object), then `get_currency_symbol(code, locale=en_locale)`.

**Verified correct**: entityStore.ts API, brokerStore.ts API, isGrouped logic (TransactionsTable), DataTable fullData/onSortChange/getEnumOptionsWithCounts, capture-phase click (use:captureClick action).

**Files corrected**: F-047.md, sources/phase07-part4-round2.md, concepts/entity-store-pattern.md, concepts/opportunistic-cache-merge.md, problems/babel-currency-symbol-locale.md.

## [2026-05-25] file | Dual-Transaction Form — TransactionFormModal paired mode (R6-B.1–B.3)

Filed discovery: TransactionFormModal.svelte now supports paired transactions (FX_CONVERSION, TRANSFER_ASSET, TRANSFER_CASH) via a dual-form mode driven by `pairFormLayout` from `transactionTypeStore`.

**Created**:
- [[decisions/dual-transaction-form-design]] — design choices: single modal with From/To layout, Da/A sign-based detection on edit, swap normalisation, `collectDualCreates()` / `collectDualUpdates()`, client-side same-currency/same-broker validation

**Updated**:
- [[features/F-047]] — added TransactionFormModal to modal inventory + source files table; added `dual-transaction-form-design` to `related_decisions`
- `index.md` — added decision entry

Key implementation details captured: 3 layout modes (fx, transfer_asset, transfer_cash), `DualDraftTo` state type, partner auto-fetch in edit mode, 7 new i18n keys across 4 locales, type selector readonly in dual mode, advanced section hidden, tags/description shared across pair sides.

## [2026-05-25] ingest | Phase 7 Part 4 Rounds 3–5 (5 plan files)

Batch ingest of 5 Phase 7 Part 4 plan files covering the transaction modal system rewrite, i18n validation errors, unified batch pipeline, and server-driven type rules.

## [2026-05-28] ingest | Phase 07 Part 4 Rounds 5-6 (8 plan files — Bugfix 1-3 + Round 6 Plans A/B/B1)

Batch ingest of 8 Phase 7 Part 4 plan files covering Round 5 Bugfix 1-3 and Round 6 Plans A/B/B1. Git hash: `0351d65f`.

**Source files ingested**:
- `plan-phase07-transaction-Part4_Round5_ServerDrivenTypeRules.prompt.md` (re-anchored: R6-B expansion)

- [[sources/phase07-part4-round6-planb-delete-picker-access]] — Broker access, DeleteModal 3 layouts, PickerModal, 48+ E2E tests

**Created** (3 decisions):
- [[decisions/cash-transfer-split-promote]] — CASH_TRANSFER first-class enum + split/promote immediate endpoints
- [[decisions/context-menu-all-tables]] — ContextMenu default ON on all DataTables
- [[decisions/broker-access-min-paired]] — Paired access = min(role_A, role_B) + 3-layout delete + partner_broker_id

**Created** (1 problem):
- [[problems/dual-form-collect-duplication]] — FormModal/BulkModal duplicated collect logic → txPayloadHelpers.ts

**Updated**:
- [[sources/phase07-part4-round5-server-type-rules]] — re-anchored at `0351d65f` (R6-B expansion)

**Key architectural decisions surfaced**:
1. **CASH_TRANSFER** first-class enum (replaces VALID_MIXED_PAIRS hack); split/promote as immediate dedicated endpoints (schemas ready, backend endpoints in Plan C)
2. **ContextMenu** default ON on all DataTables (right-click + mobile long-press, zero consumer changes)
3. **Paired access = min(role_A, role_B)** — 3-layout TransactionDeleteModal (standalone/paired-full/paired-blocked); GET /brokers LEFT JOIN returning all brokers with user_role=null; partner_broker_id in TXReadItem
4. **txPayloadHelpers.ts** — shared utility eliminating 3 cascading bugs from FormModal/BulkModal logic duplication

**Pages created**: 6 sources + 3 decisions + 1 problem = 10 new wiki pages.
**Pages updated**: 7 existing pages + index.md + ingest-registry.md.

## [2026-06-17] ingest | Phase 09 Dashboard Batch
Source: `LibreFolio_developer_journal/RoadmapV4_UI/phase-09-subplan/` @ git:`24cdc40`.
Extracted concepts regarding Dashboard KPI, TWRR, MWRR algorithms, and FIFO lot tracking implementations.
Created: [[sources/phase09-dashboard-batch]], [[concepts/twrr-mwrr-algorithms]], [[concepts/fifo-lot-tracking]].
Updated: [[features/F-054]].

## [2026-06-17] ingest | Source Code v0.9.0 Batch
Source: Source Code @ git:`6d89b44`.
Ingested new source code implementations including Remotion Video Promo, MkDocs Pros/Cons Slider, and Gallery Overhaul.
Created: [[sources/source-code-v0.9.0-batch]], [[entities/video-promo-remotion]], [[concepts/interactive-pros-cons-slider]].

## [2026-07-01] lint | Full wiki health check — post Phase 7-9 ingest

Graph: 6399 nodes, 17688 edges, 366 communities. 1080 corpus files.
God nodes: Currency (426 edges), TransactionType (199), Transaction (166), User (158), Asset (152).
Issues found: 4 (1 high, 2 medium, 1 low).

Repaired:
- [HIGH] Dead link in `index.md`: `problems/pydantic-422-pre-emption` → `problems/pydantic-422-preemption` (typo fix)

Deferred (medium):
- Index drift: 20 wiki/features/ files not listed in index.md (F-001–F-074 gaps) — acceptable: index uses domains as navigation hub, not exhaustive feature list
- Concept debt: "Phase 07 Part 4" node cluster [5x] and "Multi-Broker Atomic Transaction Batch" [4x] without new concept pages — already covered by decisions/multi-broker-atomic-tx.md and source pages

Low:
- graph.html not regenerated (6399 nodes > 5000 threshold)

Next recommended: ingest Phase 10 / next development cycle when available.

## [2026-07-01] graphify | Incremental update — portfolio engine 3-pool refactor

Graph updated: 6514 nodes (+115 vs pre-update 6399), 17914 edges (+226), 411 communities.
Changed files: portfolio_engine.py (AST) + 8 mkdocs risk-metrics/WAC docs (semantic) + 6 new wiki pages.
False-deleted manifest paths (corpus/corpus/ double-prefix) ignored — full rebuild not needed.

## [2026-07-07] ingest | Phase 09 M1/M2 archive closeout (Holdings/Performance panel, verification pass)

Source: `LibreFolio_developer_journal/RoadmapV4_UI/phases/phase-09-subplan/` (Milestone_1/, Milestone_2/ incl. `lowDashboard/`, `portfolio_engine/`, `Ai_consultant_engine/`, + 6 root cross-cutting docs) @ git:`1be3fc9c` (staged `git mv`, uncommitted at ingest time).
Milestone_3 (Broker UI v2) intentionally NOT archived — still in progress at old `phase-09-subplan/Milestone_3/` path.

This ingest is primarily a **closeout pass**: an exhaustive (non-sampled) verification against the current codebase found that ~20 items previously logged as "open" in `implementation_status_report.md` / `STATUS_REPORT_M2.md` / `ARCHITECTURE_CURRENT_STATE.md` (dated 2026-06-19/06-30) are now resolved by the Holdings/Performance refactor (commit `78aaa0a3`, 2026-07-06) and prior engine work (commit `39106380`, 2026-06-30): `get_summary()` wired to `PortfolioCalculationEngine`, `build_data_quality_report()` implemented, `first_position_date` present, GrowthChart stacked-area + rich tooltip, AllocationPanel Now/History toggle, DataQualityBanner unified field, TRANSACTION_IMPLIED fallback, tx double-click modal. ~7 items resolved *differently* than originally designed (architecture evolved) — recorded as [[decisions/portfolio-summary-direct-wiring]]. ~7 items remain genuinely open (low priority) — recorded in the source page and cross-linked from entity/domain pages. Per explicit user instruction, the MWRR "100x" result cap and Newton-only (non-Brent) solver choice are **deliberate design decisions, not bugs** — recorded as [[decisions/mwrr-solver-newton-cap]] with an explicit "do not record as a problem" note for future historians.

Also captured two genuinely open, unrelated pre-existing problems found during verification: a `test_transaction_implied.py` constructor-signature mismatch (6 failing tests, root cause confirmed via `pytest --junitxml`) and an unresolved `DataTable.svelte` column-resize click-no-effect bug (root cause not yet determined).

Created: [[sources/phase09-m1-m2-archive-2026-07]], [[concepts/holdings-performance-panel]], [[decisions/mwrr-solver-newton-cap]], [[decisions/portfolio-summary-direct-wiring]], [[problems/test-transaction-implied-constructor-mismatch]], [[problems/datatable-column-resize-noop]].

Updated: [[entities/portfolio-service]], [[entities/portfolio-engine]], [[concepts/twrr-mwrr-algorithms]], [[concepts/portfolio-report-unified]], [[sources/phase09-portfolio-engine-dashboard]], [[sources/phase09-portfolio-engine-3pool-refactor]], [[sources/phase09-dashboard-batch]], [[features/F-054]], [[features/F-055]], [[features/F-058]], [[features/registry]], [[domains/dashboard]], [[domains/calculations]].

Path corrections: fixed 8 files with stale `phase-09-subplan/Milestone_1|2` references (missing new `phases/` prefix introduced by the 2026-07-07 `git mv`) — [[decisions/mwrr-boundary-fix]], [[concepts/3-pool-cash-model]], [[concepts/pre-frame-frame-separation]], [[concepts/inline-wac-computation]], [[sources/phase09-portfolio-engine-3pool-refactor]], [[sources/phase09-portfolio-engine-dashboard]], [[entities/portfolio-engine]], [[sources/phase09-dashboard-batch]] (3 root-doc paths).

## [2026-07-07] graphify | Incremental update — Phase 09 M1/M2 archive closeout

Graph updated: 6527 nodes (+13 vs pre-update 6514), 18024 edges (+110), 381 communities (recomputed globally via Louvain — count not directly comparable to prior 411).
Scope: single semantic-extraction subagent chunk over the 23 wiki pages created/updated this ingest (6 new + 17 updated). 8 node IDs remapped to existing canonical IDs before merge to avoid duplicating already-modeled entities (`portfolio_engine_entity`, `portfolio_service_entity`, `decision_mwrr_boundary_fix`, `twrr_mwrr_algorithms_concept`, `portfolio_report_unified_concept`, `dashboard_document`, `f055_portfolio_charts`, `f058_roi_calculations_simple_dwr`).
Deferred (out of scope for this narrow update, left for a future full/incremental pass): semantic re-extraction of the 47 archived `phases/phase-09-subplan/` plan documents whose only change is the `git mv` path (content identical — these still show as "new" in manifest terms since their new path was never previously seen, but no new graph nodes are needed since content is unchanged); AST re-extraction of ~117 unrelated code files flagged as changed by `detect_incremental` (out of this session's scope). Manifest (`graphify-out/manifest.json`) stamped only for the 23 processed wiki files; as a side effect, `save_manifest`'s existing-entry reconciliation (root-relative re-anchoring) consolidated ~800 duplicate legacy absolute/relative key pairs and dropped 36 entries for genuinely-deleted/moved files — this is manifest hygiene, not a change to `graph.json`.
Community relabeling (Step 5, LLM-based) and `graph.html` regeneration (Step 6) skipped — graph exceeds the 5000-node HTML threshold and full community relabeling is out of proportion to a 23-file incremental update, consistent with the 2026-07-01 precedent.

## [2026-07-07] lint | Health check — post Phase 09 M1/M2 archive ingest

Graph: 6527 nodes, 18024 edges, 381 communities. 1125 corpus files.
God nodes unchanged from last lint (Currency 426, TransactionType 199, Transaction 166, User 158, BaseBulkResponse 155) — none are new-wiki-relevant.
New hyperedges from this ingest: "Dashboard Unified Report Flow", "Phase 09 Archive Closeout", "Portfolio Engine Refactor Core" — all EXTRACTED confidence 1.00, confirming the new pages integrated cleanly into existing clusters.
Issues found: 4 (0 high, 2 medium, 2 low) — all pre-existing, none introduced by this ingest.

Verified clean (explicit checks requested by user):
- No stale `phase-09-subplan/Milestone_1|2` (missing `phases/` prefix) references remain in any `wiki/` page or `index.md`. Only `raw/ingest-registry.md` and historical `log.md` entries still show the pre-move path — correct, since those are point-in-time git-hash snapshots from before the 2026-07-07 `git mv`.
- All 6 new pages have valid frontmatter, a `## Source files` table, and ≥4 inbound `[[links]]` — no new orphans.
- [[F-084]] (referenced from `domains/transactions.md`, `sources/todos.md`) not orphaned by the `domains/dashboard.md` rewrite — inbound links intact elsewhere.
- All `[[...]]` links in the 19 new/updated pages resolve to real files (bare `F-NNN` codes resolve to `features/F-NNN.md`).

Deferred (medium):
- **2 pre-existing orphan pages** (unrelated to this ingest): [[sources/phase07-part4-round3]] and [[sources/phase07-part4-round5]] — near-duplicate content of already-indexed, differently-slugged pages ([[sources/phase07-part4-round3-staging-rewrite]], [[sources/phase07-part4-round5-server-type-rules]]). Not linked from any other wiki page or from index.md. Recommend a future consolidation pass (merge or delete the duplicate slug).
- **Index drift**: 17 `wiki/features/*.md` files (F-001, F-003, F-004, F-008, F-009, F-014, F-015, F-023, F-024, F-036, F-045, F-046, F-051, F-052, F-053, F-056, F-074) not individually listed in `index.md` — same accepted pattern noted in the 2026-07-01 lint (index uses domains + Feature Registry as the navigation hub, not an exhaustive per-feature list).

Low:
- `graph.html` not regenerated (6527 nodes > 5000 threshold) — unchanged from prior lint.
- Concept debt (Interest, Dividend, Risk Metrics, TimeSeriesStore Pattern, Svelte 5 Runes Convention, "Phase 07 Part 4" cluster, "Multi-Broker Atomic Transaction Batch") — all pre-existing, already deferred in the 2026-07-01 lint as acceptable (covered by existing decision/source pages).

Not repaired this pass (deferred, low priority, unrelated to the requested ingest scope): the 2 orphan sources and the 17 unlisted feature pages.

Next recommended: a dedicated dedup pass on `sources/phase07-part4-round3.md` / `sources/phase07-part4-round5.md`; ingest Milestone 3 (Broker UI v2) once it completes.

## [2026-07-13] file | Full test suite green-up session
Ran `./dev.py test --fresh-run all` / `--resume all` to green the entire suite (14/14
categories). Filed three new problem pages for the cross-cutting infra/contract bugs found
along the way, and corrected the pre-existing [[problems/test-transaction-implied-constructor-mismatch]]
page (its proposed "signature-only" fix was verified empirically to not work — the WAC-as-price
fallback was actually removed, not renamed).
Filed: [[problems/pytest-exit-swallows-failures]], [[problems/resume-mode-stale-import]],
[[problems/brlistresponse-contract-drift]].

## [2026-07-15] ingest | Phase 09 M3 archive (Broker UI v2 redesign, chart-resolution/semantic-zoom)

Source: `LibreFolio_developer_journal/RoadmapV4_UI/phases/phase-09-subplan/Milestone_3/` (+ root
`implementation_plan.md` and 3 superseded pre-v2 designs) @ multiple git hashes (see `raw/ingest-registry.md`
— `git mv` archive, staged/uncommitted at ingest time, same pattern as the 2026-07-07 M1/M2 closeout). This
completes Phase 9 fully: all 3 Milestones now archived under `phases/phase-09-subplan/`.

Milestone 3 redesigns the Broker pages (global list + 3-tab detail) to reuse the unified `/portfolio/report`
widgets built in M1/M2, plus a cross-cutting chart-resolution/semantic-zoom workstream (7 impl plans + 1
study, written in parallel by a fleet of agents). All sub-plans verified ✅ design · ✅ implementation plan ·
✅ implemented (no open items). Key content: `GET /portfolio/asset-history` regression found-and-restored
(commit `3184a969` → `1a734008`); `GET /brokers?include_inaccessible=true` opt-in discovery; sharing icon
read-only for EDITOR/VIEWER/non-members (was OWNER-only); `BrokerBreakdown.cash_balances` added natively for
per-card NAV/Gain/quota% without N+1 calls; inline multi-broker FIFO lots panel (UI/display layer over the
existing `GET /portfolio/lots` engine output, no engine changes); daily→weekly→monthly semantic-zoom
bucketing (`timeSeriesAggregation.ts`) now shared across price/growth/allocation charts and 9 signal
overlays, plus a static compact-card variant with no interactive resolution switching.

**Explicit exclusion honored**: `LibreFolio_developer_journal/RoadmapV4_UI/fifo-engine/` (== the symlinked
`LibreFolio_devWiki/corpus/roadmap/fifo-engine/`) was deliberately NOT read, summarized, or linked from any
page in this pass, per user instruction — it is a separate, still-open FIFO/WAC/transfer engine-internals
investigation ("Analisi tecnica completa... Domande aperte e raccomandazione", 2026-07-14), unrelated to this
UI redesign and not yet ready for ingest (no decision taken yet).

Created: [[sources/phase09-m3-broker-redesign-2026-07]], [[concepts/chart-resolution-semantic-zoom]],
[[entities/time-series-aggregation]], [[decisions/broker-list-visibility-non-members]],
[[decisions/broker-card-aggregation-no-n-plus-one]], [[problems/portfolio-asset-history-regression-restored]].

Updated: [[domains/brokers]] (UI v2 redesign summary + 2 new decisions linked), [[domains/dashboard]] ("M3 in
progress, not archived" note resolved; source-file paths corrected), [[entities/portfolio-engine]] (History
row for the M3 archiving milestone).

Also refreshed, as part of the archive move itself (not a separate wiki page): two stale "codice in working
tree non ancora committato" notes in `Milestone_3/README.md` (git status confirmed both already committed),
and flagged (not fixed, out of scope) a pre-existing broken link in the same file
(`GUIDA-TOOLBAR-RESPONSIVE.md` vs. the actual `GUIDA-TOOLBAR-RESPONSIVE-v2.md` on disk) plus two unrelated
pre-existing dangling links in `phases/phase-09-dashboard.md` pointing at documents later relocated by
earlier phase-07/phase-08 archiving passes (`plan-phase05-to-08-upgrade.md`,
`plan-WacInlineValidateCommit.prompt.md`) — none caused by this session's edits, left as noise per convention.

Per plan: the skill's own final `graphify --update` step was skipped here — superseded by a full
from-scratch graphify rebuild run immediately after the post-ingest lint pass (see following log entries).

## [2026-07-15] lint | Health check — post Phase 09 M3 ingest (pre-rebuild)

Graph (pre-rebuild, unchanged from 2026-07-07): 6527 nodes, 18024 edges, 381 communities, 1125 corpus files —
run intentionally BEFORE the full graphify rebuild per plan, so cheap file-based checks fix issues before the
costly rebuild processes the final state once. Graph-based checks (god nodes, high-degree gaps) therefore
still reflect the pre-ingest graph — the 6 new M3 pages aren't graphed yet; expected, not a defect. God nodes
unchanged from the 2026-07-07 lint (`Currency` 426, `TransactionType` 199, `Transaction` 166, `User` 158,
`BaseBulkResponse` 155) — all pre-existing code entities, none newly relevant to this ingest.

File-based checks on the 6 new + 3 updated pages from this ingest: **all clean**.
- Orphans: 0 — every new page has 3-5 inbound `[[links]]` (verified programmatically).
- Index drift: 0 — all `wiki/**/*.md` files are listed in `index.md`.
- Broken `[[wikilinks]]`: 0 introduced by this ingest (checked all 1537 wikilinks across 322 wiki files).

Issues found: 2, both pre-existing and unrelated to this ingest (deferred, not auto-repaired, following the
same scoping precedent set in the 2026-07-07 lint for the 2 unrelated orphan sources found then):
- `wiki/sources/kb-01-backend.md` → `[[concepts/provider-registry-pattern]]` — target page does not exist.
- `wiki/sources/phase06-step4-planc.md` → `[[problems/sync-pairs-bulk-none]]` (×2) — target page does not
  exist.

Carried over from the 2026-07-07 lint, still not repaired (unrelated to this ingest, same as before): the 2
near-duplicate orphan sources ([[sources/phase07-part4-round3]], [[sources/phase07-part4-round5]]) and the 17
`wiki/features/*.md` pages not individually listed in `index.md`.

Next recommended: full graphify rebuild (this session, immediately following); a dedicated pass on the 2
newly-found broken links + the carried-over dedup/index-drift items above, whenever a general wiki-cleanup
session is scheduled (not part of this ingest's scope).

## [2026-07-15] file | AI export prompt catalog

Filed the AI export rework done this session: single "Full/Data-only" prompt replaced by a 6-entry
single-purpose prompt catalog (Snapshot, PAC Planning, Rebalancing, Market Trend, Income Review,
Describe Portfolio) plus a new single-asset export (Asset Detail Signals panel button). Also fixed a
real bug where several call sites used ticker/ISIN as the primary asset label instead of `name`.
Filed: [[decisions/ai-export-prompt-catalog]], [[problems/ai-export-name-not-ticker]].

## [2026-07-16] update | graphify full incremental rebuild (9 days of drift)

Ran `/graphify --update` on the devWiki corpus for the first time since 2026-07-07 — picked up 154
changed files (42 code, 109 document, 3 image) across this session's AI export work AND other
concurrent work (a "donation popup" feature: `donation_popup_service.py`, `DonationPopupModal.svelte`,
`donationPopupStore.svelte.ts`; new mkdocs financial-theory pages on risk metrics — Sharpe/Sortino/
max-drawdown/volatility/WAC; several dashboard chart component tweaks). 8 genuine deletions pruned
(stale audit/working files already archived into `phase-final-subplan/`).

**Bug found and worked around** (library issue, not a devWiki content problem): `graphify`'s
`detect_incremental()` auto-detects `follow_symlinks` based on whether the **scan root's direct
children** are symlinks. This corpus's symlinks (`corpus/backend`, `corpus/roadmap`, `corpus/wiki`,
etc.) sit one level *inside* `corpus/`, not at the devWiki root — so calling
`detect_incremental(Path('.'))` (the natural root, matching the original build) auto-detected
`follow_symlinks=False` and silently skipped ~1100 files, while the *first* attempt using
`Path('corpus')` as root (which does have direct symlinked children) tripped a separate manifest
re-anchoring bug (`_to_absolute_from_storage` double-prepends the root when manifest keys were saved
relative to a *different* root than the one passed in) that misreported **1052-1079 real files as
deleted**. Neither call was safe as-is. Fix: always call `detect_incremental(Path('.'),
follow_symlinks=True)` for this corpus, and re-saved `manifest.json` via `save_manifest(files,
root=Path('.'))` using that same combination, so future `--update` runs are self-consistent (verified:
a repeat `detect_incremental` immediately after now reports 0 deletions).

Graph: 6527→6850 nodes, 18024→20236 edges, 381→283 communities (labeled all 283 by hand from
top-degree node samples). Re-ran token benchmark (114.4x reduction) and regenerated `graph.html`/
`GRAPH_REPORT.md`/`graph.json`. HTML viz note: graph now exceeds the 5,000-node auto-viz cap, so
`graph.html` reflects the last run under that cap — regenerate manually via Obsidian export if a fresh
interactive view is needed.

Not filed as a dedicated wiki page (this is graphify tooling/process bookkeeping, not
LibreFolio-product knowledge) — recorded here in the log only.




## [2026-07-20] file | Docker System Info fix + macOS entrypoint GID collision
Fixed Settings → About "Copy for Issue" showing `App Version: unknown` and empty
Backend/Frontend Dependencies when running from the Docker image (root cause: `.git/`,
`Pipfile`, and `frontend/package.json` were never copied into the runtime-only image).
Mirrored the existing `requirements.txt` generated-artifact pattern with a new `VERSION`
file written fresh by `dev.py` before each `docker build`. Bonus fix: `parse_pipfile()`
regex couldn't match quoted Pipfile keys, so "Borsa Italiana Scraping" was invisible in
Backend Dependencies in *both* environments. Added a new `deployment_mode` field
(docker/local) plus 6 new About-tab diagnostic fields (viewport, DPR, browser UA, theme,
language) with full i18n. While verifying the Docker fix, discovered and flagged (not
fixed, per user's own-review-first workflow preference) a separate, still-open bug:
`entrypoint.sh`'s `chown` fails on macOS hosts because GID 20 (macOS default first-user
GID) collides with Debian's pre-existing `dialout` group, so `groupadd -g 20 librefolio`
silently no-ops and the literal group name never exists.
Filed: [[problems/docker-system-info-missing-deps]], [[problems/docker-entrypoint-gid20-collision]].
Graph updated (scoped, not a full rebuild): +2 nodes, +3 edges (both new problem nodes
cross-reference each other and [[decisions/single-docker-image]]); 6850 pre-existing nodes/edges/
communities left untouched. Manifest stamped only for these 2 files. Deferred: 126 unrelated
files still show as changed in `detect_incremental` (concurrent uncommitted work — mkdocs
restructuring, chart components, DataTable, etc., none of it mine) — left for a dedicated full
catch-up pass, same precedent as the 2026-07-01 entry above.

## [2026-07-22] ingest | FIFO Engine v4 — FEE/TAX Integration

Ingested the completed `RoadmapV4_UI/fifo-engine/v4-fee_tax_integration/` plan chain (6 feasibility drafts,
4 high-level-design drafts, implementation plan, recap, review checklist, post-implementation review — 14
files, ~450KB) plus the 4 parent `fifo-engine/` background docs. This is the plan behind the mkdocs
`fifo-lot-analysis.en.md`/`fee.en.md` translation-alignment work done earlier in this same session. Read via
a dedicated extraction subagent (post-implementation-review-v5/recap/checklist/hig-level-analysis-v5/
feasibility-v4.1/implementation-plan-v5 read in full; earlier drafts skimmed only for rejected pivots).

Summary: v4 moved dividend/interest/FEE/TAX allocation into the FIFO domain via one canonical
`FifoLotEngine.run()` path (the old service-level income allocator was deleted, not left coexisting). Income
eligibility tightened to D-1, broker-scoped, transfer-aware. Asset-linked FEE/TAX route through distinct
deterministic matching ladders (FEE trade-centric, TAX income-first); assetless costs never enter FIFO at all.
Net metrics are always gross minus allocated costs, gross math untouched. Portfolio-Engine-side reconciliation
was deliberately deferred as separate, higher-risk future work.

Created: [[sources/fifo-v4-fee-tax-integration]], [[decisions/fifo-v4-income-eligibility-d1]],
[[decisions/fifo-v4-cost-allocation-ladder]], [[decisions/fifo-v4-engine-architecture]],
[[decisions/fifo-v4-gross-net-status-model]], [[decisions/fifo-v4-validation-and-scope]],
[[entities/fifo-lot-engine]], [[entities/lots-analysis-service]], [[concepts/d1-income-eligibility-window]],
[[concepts/deterministic-cost-matching-ladder]], [[concepts/asset-orphan-vs-portfolio-level-cost]],
[[concepts/gross-net-dual-reporting]], [[problems/datatable-net-columns-hidden-override-model]],
[[problems/transaction-update-bypassed-sign-validation]],
[[problems/fifo-income-silently-dropped-after-full-close]].

Updated: [[entities/portfolio-engine]] (deferred-reconciliation note), [[concepts/fifo-lot-tracking]] (v4
evolution note), `wiki/features/registry.md` (F-056 mkdocs column).

**Drift found and fixed** (not part of the plan itself, discovered while cross-linking): [[decisions/fifo-runtime-decision]]
and [[features/F-056]] both referenced `backend/app/services/transaction_service.py` as "the FIFO engine" —
verified stale via `grep -c fifo` across the three candidate files (`fifo_lot_engine.py` and
`lots_analysis_service.py` are the real FIFO code now, `transaction_service.py` only has 2 incidental mentions).
Corrected both pages' source-file tables and added a dated correction note rather than silently rewriting
history.

Next recommended: full `graphify --update` (immediately following, same session) to absorb these 18 new/updated
wiki pages plus the outstanding backlog explicitly deferred in the 2026-07-20 entry above (126 files) and this
session's mkdocs translation-alignment changes (fee.en.md/fifo-lot-analysis.en.md + it/fr/es).

## [2026-07-22] update | graphify full incremental rebuild (18 devWiki pages + 214-file backlog catch-up)

Ran `/graphify --update` on the devWiki corpus, catching up the entire backlog deferred since 2026-07-20 (126
files) plus this session's own changes: `detect_incremental(Path('.'), follow_symlinks=True)` reported 214
changed paths (89 unique documents once `corpus/wiki/*` vs `wiki/*` symlink duplicates were manually deduped
to 194 real files, 125 code). Dispatched 10 parallel semantic-extraction subagents (chunked by directory,
~20 files each) alongside AST extraction on the 125 code files; merged into the existing graph via
`G_existing.update(G_new)` (no deletions this round).

Graph: 6852→8276 nodes (+1424), 20239→23731 edges (+3492), 283→325 communities (325 re-labeled: ~20 hand-crafted
for the FIFO/wiki-relevant clusters, the remaining ~225 sizable ones auto-labeled via a top-degree-node
heuristic — lower quality than a full hand pass but functional; flagged as a candidate for a future dedicated
labeling session). `graph.html` NOT regenerated — graph now exceeds the 5,000-node auto-viz cap (was already
noted as an open item from the 2026-07-16 entry; still open, use Obsidian export if a fresh interactive view is
needed). Token-reduction benchmark: 61.7x. Manifest re-saved via `save_manifest(files, root=Path('.'))` for all
1617 corpus files, matching the follow_symlinks/root fix documented in the 2026-07-16 entry (verified
self-consistent going forward).

Notable new structure confirms the ingest landed correctly: dedicated hyperedges for "FIFO v4 FEE/TAX design
decisions", "FIFO v4 economic-allocation concept cluster", "FIFO v4 post-implementation review bug fixes", and
"FIFO runtime implementation surface" (the last one linking the corrected [[decisions/fifo-runtime-decision]]/
[[features/F-056]] to the new [[entities/fifo-lot-engine]]/[[entities/lots-analysis-service]] — confirms the
drift fix is graph-visible). Also surfaced code-level structure not part of this ingest: BRIM broker-provider
family clusters (`Cashless Crypto Adjustment Importers`, `BRIM CSV Import Provider Family`, etc.) and a
`Column Visibility Override Ecosystem` hyperedge matching the DataTable bug fix pattern.

**Known limitations of this run** (methodology notes, not content problems):
- Per-agent token usage wasn't available the way native graphify tooling exposes it, so `cost.json` recorded
  0 input/0 output tokens for this run — cost tracking is under-counted from here, not accurate.
- A handful of near-duplicate node IDs exist for the same real entity across different subagent chunks (e.g.
  `F_056` vs `wiki_features_F-056`) — cosmetic, matches an existing pre-ingest pattern already flagged
  elsewhere in the report as "surprising connections", not fixed.
- `graphify`'s own `graph_diff()` helper compares the full old graph against only the incremental extraction
  (not the full merged graph), so its "nodes/edges removed" output is not a real deletion count in `--update`
  mode — only its "new_nodes"/"new_edges" figures are meaningful here (used above); this is a re-confirmation
  of a diff-methodology quirk, not a new bug.

## [2026-07-22] lint | Health check (post-ingest)

Ran the wiki-lint workflow immediately after the ingest above.

**Graph analysis**: God nodes unchanged in kind (`Currency`, `TransactionType`, `Transaction`, `User`, `Asset`
still top 5) but `BRIMParseError`/`BRIMParseOutput` newly entered the top 10 (162/137 edges) as a direct result
of this update's BRIM-provider semantic pass. Surprising connections list unchanged from before this ingest
(same 5 pre-existing INFERRED pairs) — no new surprising/dubious edges introduced by this ingest's own content.

**🔴 High priority**: none found specific to this ingest.

**🟡 Medium priority**:
1. **Orphan pages (81 total, pre-existing, not introduced by this ingest)** — corrected the orphan-check
   script's own bug first (the literal `grep "\[\[$slug\]\]"` bare-slug pattern from the skill undercounts,
   since `wiki/sources/` and `wiki/entities/` pages are conventionally linked with the qualified
   `[[category/slug]]` form). With a basename-aware check, genuine orphans are ~81, concentrated in
   `wiki/sources/*.md` (44 — mostly by design, linked only from `index.md`'s Sources table, consistent with the
   2026-07-15 lint's precedent of treating this as accepted) and `wiki/domains/*.md`/`wiki/connections/*.md` (9,
   likely the same pattern). Higher-signal subset worth a future pass: 7 orphaned `wiki/problems/*.md` pages
   (`justetf-websocket-disconnect`, `sync-functions-dead-code`, `pydantic-422-preemption`,
   `pytest-exit-swallows-failures`, `coverage-mode-stale-import`, `coverage-report-category-dest-collision`,
   `brlistresponse-contract-drift`), 3 orphaned `wiki/decisions/*.md` (`port-6040-scheme`,
   `provider-shutdown-generic`, `static-metadata-export`), plus `wiki/entities/devpy-cli.md` and
   `wiki/concepts/responsive-4mode-layout.md`. None of this ingest's 15 new pages are orphaned.
2. **Drift-registry false positives** — the standard `git diff {hash} HEAD -- {path}` drift check flagged 91
   sources as ">5 lines changed", but 82 of those are `git mv`-archived plan files (Phase 06/07 → `phases/`
   subfolders) where the recorded ingest hash predates the move, so git shows a spurious 100% "new file" diff
   at the archived path — not real content drift. Refined check (excluding new/deleted-file-mode diffs) finds
   only **9 genuine in-place stale sources**, most notably `backend/app/services/asset_source_providers/justetf.py`
   (211 lines changed since hash `e8ab12a`), `.../scheduled_investment.py` (190 lines) and
   `frontend/src/lib/stores/fxStoreRegistry.ts` (183 lines) — all three worth a dedicated re-ingest/refresh pass;
   `backend/app/db/models.py` (47 lines, 2 registry rows) is a smaller but recurring one worth checking against
   `wiki/entities/db-models.md`. `README.md`/`Dockerfile`/`TODO_FUTURI.md`/`phases/00-index.md` also flagged but
   are expected-to-churn living documents, not concerning.
3. **Concept debt (pre-existing, sampled pre-update)**: recurring un-paged concepts from `conceptually_related_to`
   edges include "Semantic Zoom Chart Resolution" (15×) and "MWRR as XIRR" (10×) as the most citable candidates
   for a dedicated `wiki/concepts/` page in a future session.

**🟢 Low priority**:
4. Index drift: none — every `wiki/**/*.md` page is already referenced in `index.md` (checked all 340 pages).
5. Near-duplicate node IDs for the same entity (`F_056` vs `wiki_features_F-056`) noted above under the
   graphify update entry — cosmetic only.

**Repairs executed as part of this pass**: none beyond what the ingest above already did (the drift/orphan
findings are reported for a future dedicated session, consistent with the deferral precedent set in the
2026-07-01/2026-07-16/2026-07-20 entries above — this pass's own scope was the FIFO v4 ingest, not a general
wiki cleanup).

Next recommended: (a) re-ingest/refresh the 3 genuinely-stale backend/frontend sources above; (b) a dedicated
orphan-linking pass for the 7 problem + 3 decision pages listed above; (c) hand-relabel the ~225 auto-labeled
communities from this update if/when the graph is used for browsing rather than query.

## [2026-08-04] update | graphify scoped semantic refresh (1 wiki decision page)

Scoped graph refresh for the three files changed by the ai-export-contextual-ui-memory wiki-file operation
(`wiki/decisions/ai-export-contextual-ui-memory.md`, `index.md`, `log.md`). Only one of the three is tracked
by graphify (`wiki/decisions/ai-export-contextual-ui-memory.md`; the wiki-root `index.md`/`log.md` are outside
`corpus/` and are not graphify-tracked files).

**Context**: `detect_incremental(Path('corpus/'))` reported 246 pending files (214 code + 32 documents) — an
accumulation of unrelated changes. Running `graphify --update` over all 246 would process unrelated pending
files; instead, this entry documents the minimum scoped patch to clear only the three task-relevant files.

**Semantic change in `wiki/decisions/ai-export-contextual-ui-memory.md`**: The decision title was updated from
"AI Export drafts persist per authenticated user and UI context" to "AI Export drafts use short-lived session
memory", reflecting the 2026-08-04 cutover from durable `localStorage` to a ten-minute sliding TTL in
tab-scoped `sessionStorage`. The four sub-decision sections (Reactive Identity-Bound Memory, Raw-Note /
Effective-Option Separation, Context-Bound In-Flight Preparation, Concern-Based E2E Cutover) retain their
headings. Source-location line ranges for all four sub-nodes were re-anchored to the new file layout
(L40-L59, L60-L65, L66-L71, L72-L76). All 7 external edges from the root node were preserved unmodified
(references to auth domain, AI Export snapshot service, AI Export versioned snapshot boundary, prompt catalog,
phase-00 source, clipboard fallback problem; INFERRED link to mkdocs Contextual AI Export Draft Memory).

**GRAPH_REPORT.md** updated: one label occurrence ("…persist per authenticated user…" → "…use short-lived
session memory…") in the Surprising Connections section.

**Manifest**: `wiki/decisions/ai-export-contextual-ui-memory.md` hash updated
(old semantic_hash `8061c1eb3e63976909956a705ec7d837` → new `26a4af3fc31511790a2ffdf0bd61a348`,
mtime 1785774139.88 → 1785870347.51).

Graph: **1533→1533 nodes** (±0), **2255→2255 edges** (±0), **144→144 communities** (±0).
Remaining pending after this refresh: **245** (unrelated; will be processed in a future full `--update` pass).

## [2026-08-31] file | Consolidation campaign — five discoveries

Closing a campaign that fixed sixteen pinned defects across settings, broker
sharing, the scheduler and FX. Five findings were filed because each cost real
time to reach and would cost it again:

- **A false green nobody could have seen coming.** Five tests asserted on the
  string `$_()` returns while looking like they asserted on i18n keys. They were
  green *only because the keys were untranslated* — `svelte-i18n` echoes a
  missing key — and went red in the commit that added the translations, blaming
  the translator for a defect written weeks earlier.
  Filed: [[problems/i18n-key-assertion-false-green]].

- **`page.route()` is per context, not per suite.** An E2E asserted a global
  price count reached zero, stubbing every writer in its own browser context.
  But `PriceHistory` has no `user_id`, so other workers wrote the row anyway —
  217 commits of "14 row(s) written/updated" in the backend log of the failing
  run. Passing in isolation proved nothing.
  Filed: [[problems/playwright-route-stub-is-per-context]].

- **The scheduler's defect was the conversion point, not the model.** Days and
  times stored in UTC could not be displayed in another zone without lying about
  the weekday. Storing in the configured zone and converting once, at the
  decision, removed the defect by construction *and* stopped DST from moving jobs
  by an hour twice a year. The proposed `(day, time)` redesign was unnecessary.
  Filed: [[decisions/scheduler-converts-at-decision]].

- **Zero is not an exchange rate.** An absence was travelling with the shape of a
  datum from the API boundary onward, drawing collapses to zero in charts and a
  reachable −100 % delta. Widening the type *first* let `svelte-check` enumerate
  40 sites across 7 files — more than the manual estimate, and it found two
  consumers the survey had missed.
  Filed: [[concepts/absence-sentinel-vs-nullable-type]].

- **A near-miss in a shared component.** Fixing the FX chart gap set
  `connectNulls: false` globally, which would have inverted every overlay in the
  application; overlays had been `true`. Caught by asking who else passes through
  the file, not by a test — no test would have caught it.
  Filed: [[problems/shared-component-option-changed-globally]].

Suite at filing time: 15/15 green in 46m 55s, lines 78,02 %, branch arms
59,45 %, backend 90,18 %.

> **Provenance added 2026-09-01.** `90,18 %` is **lines + branch arms — the same
> formula as the 90,10 %** quoted elsewhere in the campaign, not a third scale. It is
> the `TOTAL` row of `htmlcov-backend/index.html`
> (`37085 / 2810 / 11048 / 1719`) from the final validation run of 2026-08-31:
> `dev.py test --fresh-run --coverage all --cov-clean-js --cov-clean-backend
> --cov-clean-backend-e2e --workers 8 all`. The distance from 90,10 is two successive
> measurements with the scheduler work and its tests in between, not a change of
> definition.
>
> **`92,33 %` is the only pure-lines figure in the campaign.** Comparing it with
> 90,18 compares two formulas — the error documented in
> [[problems/coverage-percent-mixed-lines-and-branches]]. Within the mixed set
> (90,10 · 90,46 · 92,40 · 90,18) the figures are comparable to each other.
>
> The frontend pair is comparable to its neighbours (78,07/59,39 and 78,13/59,53 at
> the two recorded checkpoints). Worker counts for the **earlier** figures remain
> **not reconstructible**; for this one it is known and recorded above.
> See [[sources/coverage-campaign-2026-08]] § Caveats.

## [2026-08-31] ingest | Consolidation campaign — 13 session plans + the 2026-08-05 beta testing folder

**Sources**: 14 untracked plan/history files from the session state directory
(`plan-p7-js-coverage`, `plan-p8-runner-migration`,
`plan-p9-test-semantics-COMPLETO`, `plan-tappe-7-11-parallelismo-COMPLETO`,
`tappa9-desleep`, `plan-storico-coverage-campaign` and `-2`,
`plan-storico-fase012`, `plan-storico-corsie-sync-e-logica`,
`coda-beta-parametrici-forkserver`, `difetti-aperti-corsia-impostazioni`,
`plan-storico-corsia-impostazioni-COMPLETO`,
`plan-storico-undici-difetti-COMPLETO`, plus
`plan-storico-scheduler-e-fx-COMPLETO` found in the directory but absent from the
supplied inventory) — and four files from
`LibreFolio_developer_journal/Release_2/Phase_0/06_betaTestingReportAndFixing/`
(`571bcde0`, `6eac0225`), a folder never ingested before.

**Created — 31 pages.**

*Concepts (9)* — the runner's execution model and the vocabulary the campaign
needed to read its own numbers: [[concepts/test-isolation-classes]],
[[concepts/derived-test-inventory]],
[[concepts/run-cache-and-campaign-semantics]],
[[concepts/playwright-run-consolidation]],
[[concepts/transaction-hygiene-fixture]],
[[concepts/load-only-red-is-a-product-defect]],
[[concepts/coverage-rate-vs-volume]], [[concepts/characterisation-test-latch]],
[[concepts/discard-the-answer-not-the-question]].

*Problems (11)* — five of them share one property worth naming: they produce
**no signal at all**. Empty coverage files, unreachable test actions, an env var
that yields a default instead of an error, a cache that stops caching, a barrel
nobody imports. [[problems/svelte-template-branches-not-instrumented]],
[[problems/coverage-percent-mixed-lines-and-branches]],
[[problems/e2e-python-coverage-lost-above-two-workers]],
[[problems/registered-but-unreachable-test-actions]],
[[problems/conftest-autouse-write-breaks-pure-class]],
[[problems/brim-file-store-rename-race]],
[[problems/commit-reported-success-on-rolled-back-batch]],
[[problems/utc-today-vs-user-calendar]],
[[problems/namedcache-clear-leaves-admission-filter]],
[[problems/env-var-injection-point-duplicated]],
[[problems/bulk-validate-index-map-off-by-one]].

*Decisions (2)* — [[decisions/settings-write-path-contract]] (C1-C9 as one
contract: confirm late, show the wait, never lose a field) and
[[decisions/broker-last-owner-guard]] (recorded precisely because the obvious
five-minute repair is the wrong one).

*Sources (9)* — [[sources/p7-js-coverage-instrumentation]],
[[sources/p8-runner-parallel-architecture]], [[sources/p9-test-semantics]],
[[sources/frontend-parallelism-tappe-7-11]],
[[sources/coverage-campaign-2026-08]],
[[sources/coverage-fase012-and-branch-lanes]],
[[sources/settings-lane-and-sixteen-defects]],
[[sources/coda-beta-parametric-forkserver]],
[[sources/beta-testing-2026-08-05]].

**Updated — 7 pages.**
[[concepts/backend-test-isolation]] now carries a superseded-in-part warning: its
"parallel-safe, no cleanup required" claim is contradicted by a single-process
run that produced three `UNIQUE constraint failed` failures, and by the fact that
56 test files share one SQLite file against 16 using `:memory:`. Not repaired —
flagged. [[decisions/test-runner-package-split]] gained a History section: 18
modules/12 categories/~115 actions has become 31/15/219, and the decision was not
reversed but built upon. The five pages filed by hand a few hours earlier gained
`See also` blocks linking them into the new material, without rewriting them.

**Not ingested, deliberately**: the ten `plan-phase00*.prompt.md` execution plans
in the beta folder (operational, and their durable content lives in the taxonomy
or in existing `phase00-*` pages), plus the non-prose artefacts in the session
directory (`draft-*.ts`, `collect_pass.py`, `drift_check.py`, `spec_class.txt`,
screenshots, a compressed log).

**Correction, same day.** The two cases named as "four workers revealed a
user-facing bug" were not in the session plans — they are in
`.github/agents/test-author.agent.md` (~538-552) and
`.github/skills/devpy-tools/testing-frontend/SKILL.md` (~313). They have been
written into [[concepts/load-only-red-is-a-product-defect]] in their true form:
`AssetSearchAutocomplete` dropped a query typed before the provider list loaded —
at one worker the providers *always* won the race, so the defect was not rare but
**unobservable**, and the suite was green for months on a dead search box; and
`useValidateScheduler` sampled its anti-bounce key when the response *arrived*
instead of when the request *left*, so an edit made during a pending validation
was marked already-validated and never re-checked. Four tests always red under
load, always green alone, always the same four — the exact signature people
dismiss as flaky.

The `resolveOps` / `buildOpsIndexMap` off-by-one that had been placed there
provisionally was **not** a load-only red: it was found statically by the
pure-logic lane. Split out into
[[problems/bulk-validate-index-map-off-by-one]].

**index.md**: 267 → 298 unique links (273 → 304 table rows).

**Not run**: `graphify --update` — deferred to the maintainer, after the lint
pass, so the ~1 280-file queue is processed once.

## [2026-09-01] lint | Health check after the 2026-08-31 consolidation ingest

**Scope**: 400 wiki pages, 439 index links, 1 828 source-file paths cited in
`## Source files` tables, 454 manifest entries, graph built on 100 files.

**The finding that dominates every other**: the wiki's navigation layer is
broken against the current tree. **144 of the 1 828 cited source paths (7,9 %)
point at files that do not exist.** 85 of them are files that *moved* — the
frontend `stores/`, `utils/` and `components/transactions/` trees were regrouped
on **2026-06-05** (`99144b67`, `ee84e078`) and the backend financial utils on
**2026-06-10** (`79ea14e5`) — and 59 name files that exist nowhere under any
name. **23 of the 38 pages written or touched by the 2026-08-31 ingest** contain
at least one such path, i.e. the ingest transcribed plan-era paths that were
already three months stale when it wrote them.

**Verified against the code, contradicted**:
- `concepts/backend-test-isolation` — `unique_id()` does **not** combine
  timestamp + UUID4. `backend/test_scripts/test_utils.py:180` returns
  `f"{prefix}_{int(time.time()*1000)}_{_counter}"` with a **process-global
  counter**. The page's parallel-safety argument rests on a mechanism that is
  not in the code. The superseded-warning added by the ingest does not say this.
- `decisions/test-runner-package-split` — the History added by the ingest says
  31 modules / 15 categories / 219 actions. Code: **30 modules, 15 categories,
  250 `add_test()` call sites**. It also says the flat `_backend_*` /
  `_frontend_*` layout "was reorganised around an `actions/` package" — that
  package does not exist; the flat layout is still there.
- `entities/test-runner` — the directory tree, the `@registry.register`
  decorator and the `suites/` package it documents do not exist. Not touched by
  the ingest despite three new concept pages on the same package.
- The `:memory:` / shared-file counts in the ingest's own warning (16 / 56) are
  **7 / 36** in the tree today (195 test files total).

**Repaired (mechanical only)**: `features/registry.md` was missing **F-048**,
the most-linked feature page in the wiki (43 inbound links); 2 broken
`[[links]]`; 6 broken frontmatter refs (`phase07-part4-round4-pipeline`,
two nested-bracket typos, `responsive-layout-strategy`,
`three-phase-pipeline-pattern`, `sync-modal-base-pattern`). Broken `[[links]]`
now **0**.

**Duplicates found (pre-existing, not from this ingest)**:
`sources/phase07-part4-round3` ≡ `sources/phase07-part4-round3-staging-rewrite`
and `sources/phase07-part4-round5` ≡ `sources/phase07-part4-round5-server-type-rules`
— same `original_path`, same title modulo "Phase 07"/"Phase 7", ingested twice
(2026-05-25 and 2026-05-28). Both older copies are orphans and absent from
`index.md`. Merge deferred: it is a judgement call about which slug survives.

**Deferred, needs a decision**: the `unique_id` reconciliation (owner of the
fixture); whether `entities/test-runner` is rewritten or retired; the
`decisions/fx-triangulation` and `assert-on-identity-not-prose` references that
name pages nobody ever wrote; `index.md` carries 58 duplicate rows across its
"Recent Additions" sections.

**Also noted, not corrected on purpose**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md:155`
claims the graph has 9 259 nodes / 14 151 edges / 748 communities. The current
`GRAPH_REPORT.md` says **1 617 / 2 277 / 167**, built from 100 files. Left for
the maintainer to fix after the rebuild, so the number is written once.

**Not run**: `graphify --update` — the ~1 280-file queue stays with the
maintainer.

## [2026-09-01] tooling | check_source_paths.py

Il lint ha trovato **144 path su 1 828 (7,9 %)** citati nelle tabelle `## Source
files` puntati a file inesistenti, e la ripartizione contava più del totale: 85
erano deriva databile da tre refactor di giugno, 59 non esistevano da nessuna
parte, **4 erano inventati**. E 23 delle 38 pagine scritte il giorno prima ne
contenevano almeno uno — quindi non invecchiamento, ma trascrizione di path
presi dai piani senza confronto con l'albero.

Nessuna delle tre classi sopravvive a un controllo di esistenza su filesystem, e
**nessuna era visibile al grafo**, che copre ~4 % del codice: una query BFS
risponde parzialmente e sembra completa.

Aggiunto `check_source_paths.py`, che verifica ogni path citato. Dopo le
riparazioni: **41 rotti su 2 016 citati (2,0 %)**, da 7,9 %. Va eseguito **prima**
di scrivere una pagina, non sei mesi dopo.

Aggiornate anche le istruzioni di progetto: il numero di nodi del grafo era fermo
a 9 259 contro i ~1 617 reali, e ora rimandano a `GRAPH_REPORT.md` invece di
riportare una cifra destinata a invecchiare. Con l'avvertenza che conta: il grafo
è affidabile sulla conoscenza accumulata, **cieco sul codice**.

## [2026-09-01] lint | code-reality-check.md marcato superato

Generato il 2025-05-24, afferma *«Alembic: 1 sola migrazione — conforme alle
istruzioni "no incremental migrations"»*. Le istruzioni oggi impongono l'**opposto**:
migrazioni incrementali per non rompere le installazioni rilasciate. Una pagina
che verifica la conformità al codice e sbaglia sulla regola più delicata è essa
stessa deriva. Avviso in testa, non riscritta: serve come fotografia del maggio
2025, non come verifica.

## [2026-09-02] file | Drawdown full_history warmup (decision)

Consolidamento beta P4/E1: il drawdown ha memoria illimitata — `full_history` param
sul segnale (toggle UI, default on), AI Export sempre full; documentato perché il
seed SQL del max pre-periodo è FX-unsafe (max(convertita) ≠ convertita(max)).
Filed: [[decisions/drawdown-full-history-warmup]].

## [2026-09-02] file | CompactCashCell decimal separator feedback loop (problem)

T1: l'`$effect` di sync confrontava stringhe di display e sovrascriveva il buffer
mid-typing (`12,` → `12`); fix = confronto numerico normalizzato. Include la trappola
`isVisible({timeout})` che non attende (emersa con il tooltip delay T2).
Filed: [[problems/compactcashcell-decimal-separator-feedback-loop]].

2026-09-03 — P1 audit wave executed (all 18 tasks): C901 gate@10 (199 sites triaged: 173 flat noqa, 26 TODO-refactor), TRY400 55/55, dead code backend+frontend, i18n -25 keys, currency-graph dead machinery removed (user hypothesis confirmed), response_model ×6 + TS discriminator fix (enum extra + post-processor list), spawn-worker coverage via sitecustomize. Filed: [[problems/sitecustomize-shadows-homebrew-python]] (PYTHONPATH sitecustomize shadowing Homebrew's → pipenv broken; chain-exec fix). WS-H migration proof: published 1.0.1 image → current image on same volume, both data migrations verified correct.
