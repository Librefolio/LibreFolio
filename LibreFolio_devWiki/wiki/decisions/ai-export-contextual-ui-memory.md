# Decision: AI Export drafts use short-lived session memory

## Context

The first Phase 0 options panel treated closing a modified draft as a discard event and asked for confirmation. Manual desktop/mobile review found that behavior disruptive: selection, detail, period, and notes are working context that users expect to recover when they reopen AI Export. A single browser-global draft was unsafe because the four surfaces represent different entities and the SPA can survive logout/login transitions between users.

The V2 cutover exposed two additional races. Client-session identity and the catalog resolve asynchronously, so a one-shot load during component creation could see an anonymous/empty state and fail to hydrate a valid draft after navigation. Snapshot preparation also outlives its initiating UI context unless late results are explicitly invalidated: navigation, logout, selection changes, panel close, or component destruction could otherwise persist or copy stale output. Dataset selections hide Analysis notes, so visual hiding also had to remain separate from the effective request and prompt contract.

On 2026-08-04, manual multi-login testing showed that durable `localStorage`
memory was inappropriate for prompt notes and options. The owner replaced it with
a ten-minute sliding TTL in tab-scoped `sessionStorage`; every logout/account
transition/new login clears all AI Export drafts and reopens every panel with
defaults.

## Options Considered

1. **Keep drafts only while the panel is open and confirm discard on close** — explicit, but interrupts normal navigation and loses useful context.
2. **Use one browser-global AI Export draft** — simple, but leaks choices between Portfolio, Broker, Asset, and FX contexts and risks cross-account reuse.
3. **Persist drafts in backend user settings** — portable across devices, but turns transient prompt composition into a server contract, adds synchronization/privacy scope, and was unnecessary for Phase 0.
4. **Keep drafts in validated, user/context-scoped session storage with a short TTL, clear them at every authentication transition, and bind async work to an invalidatable preparation context** — preserves brief navigation continuity without carrying notes into another login. **Chosen.**

## Decision

### Reactive identity-bound memory

- AI Export stores a strictly validated draft containing selection kind/ID, detail level, period, the raw Analysis note draft, the accepted Copy Anyway fingerprint, and `savedAt`.
- Storage keys are namespaced with the resolved client-session user ID and one context key:
  - `portfolio`;
  - `broker:{broker_id}`;
  - `asset:{asset_id}`;
  - `fx:{canonical_slug}`.
- The tab-scoped key shape is `lf_{userId}_ai_export_session_{encodedContext}`.
  An in-memory cache mirrors valid entries.
- Every write refreshes a ten-minute TTL. Reopening after expiry discards the
  entire draft and uses default selection, Standard detail, 3M period, and empty
  notes.
- Logout, account changes, and every subsequent login clear both cache and
  session storage through the shared client-session reset boundary. Obsolete V2/V3
  `localStorage` drafts are also removed at that boundary.
- The menu subscribes to the client-session user store. When async identity first resolves or later changes, it reloads the active memory key instead of treating the initial anonymous fallback as final. Catalog resolution/reload also rehydrates without deleting a valid draft merely because compatibility is temporarily empty.
- If the user is unauthenticated, storage is unavailable, JSON/schema validation fails, the TTL expired, or a stored selection/detail is no longer applicable, the panel uses safe defaults. Malformed or obsolete entries are removed. If `sessionStorage` rejects writes, valid state can still survive for the current SPA lifetime in memory.
- Draft changes persist immediately; closing the panel has no destructive confirmation. Response language is never trusted from memory and is re-derived from the active UI locale.

### Raw notes are memory, not always export options

- The raw Analysis note draft is held as `userNotesDraft`, separately from the current effective `AiExportOptionsSelection.userNotes`.
- Switching to a Dataset hides but preserves the raw note draft. Switching back to a note-capable Analysis restores it.
- Dataset selections and Analysis entries with `supports_user_notes=false` receive no notes in their effective options, options fingerprint, request, rendered prompt, or clipboard output.

### In-flight preparation is context-bound

- Every preparation captures a monotonic context epoch, unique operation ID, client-session generation and user ID, active memory key, and effective options fingerprint.
- Navigation/context-key changes, logout or user changes, option changes, panel close, catalog/user reload, and component destruction invalidate the captured context. Reload/close paths also clear pending state and reset loading immediately.
- A late result is accepted only while every captured field is still current. Guards run before clipboard writing starts, again after the async clipboard write, and before persistence, callbacks, or panel completion. Stale successes and errors therefore become inert.

### E2E and runner cutover

- The former monolithic `frontend/e2e/ai-export/` was removed. Coverage is split into panel, catalog, memory, and request/clipboard contract specs with shared helpers.
- The test runner exposes focused `panel`, `catalog`, `memory`, and `contract` actions. The `cutover` compatibility alias runs all four concern specs, while `all` runs unit coverage followed by the complete E2E set.

## Consequences

- Portfolio and each Broker, Asset, and canonical FX pair reopen with their own last selection, detail, period, and notes only within the same login/tab and ten-minute TTL.
- Users can close by trigger, Escape, outside click, or navigation without a destructive confirmation.
- Drafts are deliberately ephemeral session state, not a durable browser or cross-device preference.
- Authentication changes and new logins always reopen defaults; user IDs still namespace entries as defense in depth.
- Catalog/version drift fails closed to defaults instead of reviving an unsupported selection.
- Dataset and non-note-capable Analysis privacy is stronger than visual hiding alone: hidden notes remain useful UI memory but are structurally absent from export inputs and outputs.
- Slow snapshot or clipboard work cannot leak across routes, accounts, selections, closed panels, or destroyed components.
- Concern-based E2E files make failures and focused reruns easier to localize without weakening the canonical cutover gate.

## Validation / Success Criteria

- Unit coverage exercises ten-minute expiry, full login reset, hidden-note preservation with note-free Dataset fingerprints, delayed catalog hydration, and context isolation.
- Browser E2E verifies Portfolio/Broker/Asset/canonical-FX navigation restoration within one session, reset after login, Dataset note exclusion, and current request/clipboard contracts.
- Applied 2026-08-04 gate: **197 unit tests passed** and the complete AI Export
  cutover passed **32/32 Playwright tests** across desktop/mobile.
