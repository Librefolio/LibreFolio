# Source: FIFO Engine v4 — FEE/TAX Integration

## Summary

This plan chain closed a gap between FIFO lot analysis (quantity/custody replay, implemented in v3) and the real
economic life of an asset: dividends, interest, fees and taxes were previously handled outside the FIFO domain
(split between an ad-hoc income allocator in `LotsAnalysisService` and the Portfolio Engine), with no per-lot
cost attribution. The implemented v4/v5 design moved asset-linked income/FEE/TAX allocation into the FIFO engine
itself through one canonical flow: quantitative replay first, then deterministic economic pooling/allocation,
then combined status classification. Income entitlement was tightened to **D-1** (day before the income date)
and scoped to the **paying broker**, with transfer-aware custody rules. Asset-linked FEE/TAX now flow through
distinct deterministic matching ladders and become per-lot `allocated_fees` / `allocated_taxes`, feeding
**net** metrics that are always gross minus allocated costs — gross formulas and `original_cost` are never
mutated. The API/DTO/frontend were extended with net columns, inline 3-level economic audit, orphan aggregates,
and a 3-state analysis status. The FIFO-side of this work is implemented and verified; Portfolio-Engine-side
cross-engine reconciliation was deliberately deferred as a separate, higher-risk piece of work.

This is the plan behind the `mkdocs_src/docs/financial-theory/` doc updates (fifo-lot-analysis.en.md "Income
Allocation" D-1 rewrite + new "Costs & Net Metrics" section; fee.en.md new attribution admonition) translated
into IT/FR/ES in the same devWiki session, immediately before this ingest.

## Key Takeaways

- **D-1 income eligibility, broker-scoped**: `EligibleQuantity_i(D) = OpenQuantity_i(D-1)`, matched within the
  paying broker only (with asymmetric From/To transfer rules) — replaces the old "all LONG lots open on the
  income date itself, across all brokers" behavior. See [[decisions/fifo-v4-income-eligibility-d1]].
- **Distinct deterministic cost ladders for FEE vs TAX** (FEE is trade-centric; TAX is income-first) route
  asset-linked costs to lots, with same-day BUY+SELL pools split by value-weight and orphan as the deterministic
  fallback (never adjacent-day D+1 matching). See [[decisions/fifo-v4-cost-allocation-ladder]].
- **Assetless costs (`asset_id = null`) never enter FIFO** — they stay portfolio/broker-level, handled by the
  Portfolio Engine. See [[concepts/asset-orphan-vs-portfolio-level-cost]].
- **Gross metrics are untouched**; net metrics are additive (`gross - allocated_fees - allocated_taxes`), with a
  deliberate asymmetry: per-lot history net P&L is capital-only, while summary `net_total_pnl`/`net_total_return`
  are income-inclusive. See [[decisions/fifo-v4-gross-net-status-model]], [[concepts/gross-net-dual-reporting]].
- **One canonical engine path**: `FifoLotEngine.run()` now owns quantitative + economic allocation; the old
  service-level income allocator (`LotsAnalysisService._allocate_asset_income`) was removed, not left coexisting.
  See [[entities/fifo-lot-engine]], [[entities/lots-analysis-service]].
- **Portfolio Engine reconciliation deliberately deferred** — no pre-share absolute accumulators / cross-engine
  conservation check landed this round; flagged as future work, not a regression. See [[entities/portfolio-engine]].
- Real bugs found and fixed along the way: a `DataTable.svelte` visibility-snapshot bug hid net columns despite
  real costs ([[problems/datatable-net-columns-hidden-override-model]]); transaction UPDATE could persist a
  positive FEE/TAX where CREATE couldn't ([[problems/transaction-update-bypassed-sign-validation]]); the old
  income allocator silently dropped income when no lot was open ([[problems/fifo-income-silently-dropped-after-full-close]]).
- The wiki's pre-existing [[decisions/fifo-runtime-decision]] and [[features/F-056]] pages referenced
  `transaction_service.py` as "the FIFO engine" — verified stale (FIFO logic now lives in `fifo_lot_engine.py` /
  `lots_analysis_service.py`); corrected as part of this ingest.

## Iteration history (why so many drafts)

The directory contains 6 feasibility-analysis drafts and 4 high-level-analysis drafts before settling on the
`-v5` / `-v4.1` versions actually implemented. The rejected intermediate approaches are recorded inline in each
decision page's "Options Considered" section rather than as separate pages — notable pivots: adjacent-day D+1
matching → previous-day-only; one unified FEE+TAX ladder → separate ladders; partially-orphan TAX pools →
all-or-nothing pool; FX resolver inside the engine (Option C) → FX resolved in the service, engine stays pure
(Option B, native+target events); optional on-request cost audit → always-inline 3-level audit.
