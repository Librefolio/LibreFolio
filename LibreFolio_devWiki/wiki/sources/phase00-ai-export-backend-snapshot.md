# Source: Phase 0 — AI Export Backend Snapshot and Hard Cutover

## Summary

The completed Phase 0 chain replaces frontend-built AI Export with a typed,
versioned backend snapshot platform spanning Portfolio, Asset, FX and Broker.
The final released V1 architecture has one `AiExportRuntimeService`, 67 components, 40
internal datasets, 8 public data exports and 11 public analyses; the intermediate
profile/assembler runtime and legacy schema were removed. The frontend retains
trusted prompt presentation, locale-derived response language, short-lived
contextual notes, safe serialization and clipboard UX. Final candidate
`20260804T224056.073291Z` proved 114/114 public prompt variants unchanged
against baseline after the cleanup.

## Key Takeaways

- `AiExportRuntimeService` resolves a public Dataset/Analysis selection, derives
  user/Broker scope server-side and composes the snapshot through shared
  component/dataset/analysis registries.
- The catalog is fail-closed: any schema, selection, response-contract,
  support-flag, detail, scope or target mismatch disables the choice or rejects
  the snapshot.
- Financial and technical facts are backend-owned; curated technical bundles reuse [[decisions/signal-backend-plugin-architecture]] and never auto-enrol new plugins.
- The final analysis control is a custom accessible select whose selected value and options show icon, localized name, and localized description.
- A synthetic **Data Snapshot** choice maps each domain to its factual snapshot task with `data_only`; every real analysis maps to `full_prompt`.
- Response language always follows the active UI locale. Render-mode, response-language, web-research, and compatibility-status controls are not exposed; web research is normalized off while compatibility still fails closed internally.
- [[decisions/ai-export-contextual-ui-memory]] records browser-local persistence by client-session user ID and concrete Portfolio/Broker/Asset/canonical-FX context. Snapshot preserves the hidden notes draft in memory but structurally excludes it from effective options and clipboard output.
- The options panel is portalized to `document.body` at a layer above chart controls, with fixed viewport-aware positioning, focus restoration, and keyboard-safe ownership of its portalized select.
- The book link is domain-aware for the four English manuals and uses the localized shared AI Export page as the IT/FR/ES fallback.
- The cutover removed the legacy frontend builders, custom serializer, duplicated technical-event calculations, and local EMA/RSI/MACD/Bollinger engines while preserving comparison, benchmark, Measure, and generic backend rendering.
- Live E2E exposed a false cash equality invariant: Portfolio Engine cash uses transaction-date FX, whereas native-currency exposure uses snapshot-date FX. The resolution is filed in [[problems/ai-export-cash-fx-valuation-basis-mismatch]] and deliberately leaves Portfolio Engine math unchanged.
- Final review decoupled Asset `drawdown_recovery` from a non-empty trailing technical window: market context prefers technical observations but falls back to selected observed history, while applicability remains two selected observations. See [[problems/ai-export-drawdown-selected-history-fallback]].
- Clipboard fallback is transport-only: retain the immediate `ClipboardItem(Promise<Blob>)` path when available; otherwise prepare V1 exactly once and write the same prompt through `writeText`/`execCommand`, never through legacy export logic. See [[problems/ai-export-clipboard-fallback-unreachable]].
- Canonical test-runner registration covers service, schema, API, probe,
  frontend unit and cross-domain E2E tests. The final backend/frontend orphan
  audit is zero.
- The final 27 July gate completed the plan, approved representative desktop/mobile menu, layering, memory, manual-link, clipboard, and prompt behavior, and retained the chain in its existing archive rather than moving it into `RoadmapV4_UI/phases/`.
- The approved technical density contract keeps history at Compact 5, Standard 10,
  and Full all non-empty indicator rows. Event selection is Compact 7 calendar
  days/minimum latest 3, Standard 21 calendar days/minimum latest 10, and Full
  30 calendar days/minimum latest 20 per entity/annotation.
- Final public rendering omits only completely empty temporal rows. Observed zero,
  flow, P&L, extrema, reconciliation, economic dates, and explicit state remain;
  row diagnostics make the omission auditable.
- Broker terminology now distinguishes accessible, scoped, open-position, and
  period-contributor universes. The Entity Directory follows the effective scoped
  Brokers even when one has no current position row.
- The project owner designated `20260801T085820.657238Z` as final targeted
  evidence: 4/4 prompts, no failures/skips/regressions, UI/probe equivalence,
  passed secret scan, and unchanged source/production DBs.
- Applied-policy run `20260803T164514.504966Z` passed 7/7 prompts with zero
  failures/public violations, UI/probe equivalence, passed secret scan, and
  unchanged source/production DBs. Dense Portfolio/Broker cases can exceed 60k;
  the UI warning remains and no automatic cap is allowed.
- Documentation follow-ups are closed. `mkdocs_src/docs/developer/test-walkthrough/api.md`
  now lists `./dev.py test api ai-export`, `./dev.py test services ai-export`,
  `./dev.py test utils ai-export-probe`, `./dev.py test front-ai-export unit`,
  and the `panel`, `catalog`, `memory`, `contract`, `cutover`, and `all`
  Playwright actions.
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` now states the AI Export product and
  backend/frontend boundary. User Guide translations for IT/FR/ES are explicitly
  deferred; English remains the current source.
- The 4 August catalog explanation confirms that PAC and Rebalancing already receive
  per-position Asset rows from Overview (unit price, value, WAC, P&L, weight) and,
  when optional datasets build, per-Asset observed market context. They are not
  aggregate-only analyses.
- [[concepts/ai-export-catalog-granularity-and-composition]] distinguishes position
  unit price, observed market price, and price history; records that `all_data`
  means the union of canonical complete datasets rather than every visible menu
  choice; and explains why focused projections/evidence are excluded to prevent
  duplication.
- The same review identifies the main UX ambiguity: Technical Summary vs Asset
  Snapshot vs Asset Comparison vs Technical, Context datasets vs similarly named
  Analyses, and no visible granularity badges. It also preserves two unimplemented
  follow-ups: Broker Technical has no raw price-history component, and Asset Trend's
  Italian UI description promises Drawdown although `asset.drawdown_context` is not
  composed.
- Real Portfolio verification `20260804T085052.052297Z` passed 5/5 prompts with
  zero failures/public-output violations, UI/probe equivalence, a passed secret
  scan, and unchanged source/production databases. The report covers all 49/49
  choices against current runtime definitions.
- Public Catalog V1 exposes one general and one detailed data export
  per domain plus 11 focused analyses. Granular datasets remain internal
  composition blocks and cannot be requested directly.
- Final audit removed 21,901 source/test/runner lines while adding 890, shared
  immutable registries and catalog, replaced repeated stats dumps with one
  canonical dump plus integer fixed point, and removed deep envelope
  dump/validate round-trips.
- Baseline `20260804T214400.268752Z` and candidate
  `20260804T224056.073291Z` both passed 114/114. Comparison found zero
  character, byte, composition, event or state deltas; 66/66 Analysis variants
  are `OPTIMAL`.
- Before first release, public wire/catalog/selection/template/response versions
  were normalized to V1. The normal test runner keeps fast probe-helper tests
  but never executes a real copied-DB prompt corpus or semantic review.
