"""Pydantic payload models for the Asset-core `ComponentSpec` builders.

Deliberately independent from the public wire schemas and from
`backend.app.services.ai_export.components.catalog` (the fail-closed foundation
metadata this module implements). Every model here is `extra="forbid"`,
Decimal-safe (via
`backend.app.schemas.common.SafeDecimal`, which always serializes in plain
decimal notation - never scientific notation - see that module) and
JSON-safe, so `backend.app.services.ai_export.components.envelope.
build_envelope` can validate/serialize it deterministically.

Covers the eight non-technical Asset components (workstream E2, "Asset
core" wave): `asset.identity`, `asset.market_snapshot`,
`asset.position_scope`, `asset.provenance`, `asset.positions_by_broker`,
`asset.cost_value_pl`, `asset.performance`, `asset.lot_detail`. The three
technical Asset components (`asset.ohlc_returns`, `asset.indicators`,
`asset.states_events`) belong to the sibling technical-shared wave and are
not defined here.

Money fields fall into two categories:
- `Currency` (code + amount) is used only where the amount's currency can
  differ from `target_currency` at the row level - i.e. the native-currency
  price observation in `asset.market_snapshot`.
- Plain `SafeDecimal` is used everywhere else, because those values come
  straight from `PortfolioHolding`/`AssetPeriodContribution`/
  `LotSummarySchema` (all already expressed in the report/analysis's single
  `target_currency`) - the payload's own `target_currency` field is the one
  and only currency code for every such amount, so wrapping each row value
  in a redundant `Currency` would duplicate that code without adding
  information.
