"""Broker cost-efficiency adequacy evidence `ComponentSpec` builder (Phase 0 AI Export adequacy remediation).

A standalone, broker-owned ``broker.cost_efficiency`` component that adds the
deterministic *activity / turnover denominators* the cost-efficiency Analysis
needs on top of the recorded fee/tax figures that already exist verbatim in
``broker.flows_income_costs`` (the engine-computed ``period_fees`` /
``period_taxes`` / ``period_fees_taxes``, all already in ``target_currency``).

Design invariants (see the task hand-off notes; this module deliberately does
**not** touch any shared catalog/registry wiring):

- **Fees are never invented and never coerced to zero.** Recorded fee/tax amounts
  are read straight off the broker ``PortfolioReportResponse`` summary. A real
  zero is emitted only when at least one typed FEE/TAX source row exists and all
  its amounts are zero; no source rows remain ``unavailable``.

- **Turnover is deterministic and currency-honest.** Turnover is
  ``Σ |amount|`` over BUY/SELL settlement transactions in the inclusive period
  whose native ``currency`` equals the report ``target_currency`` - no FX
  conversion is ever performed here, so the number is fully deterministic.
  BUY (``amount < 0``) and SELL (``amount > 0``) magnitudes are summed by
  absolute value. Trades settled in a *different* currency are counted in an
  explicit coverage bucket but excluded from the turnover amount, and mark the
  turnover ``complete == False``.

- **Ratios only when numerator and denominator are both available.** The
  fees-to-turnover ratio is emitted only when fees are recorded, turnover is
  positive *and* currency-complete (so numerator and denominator share the same
  target-currency basis); the fees-to-invested and fees-to-average-NAV ratios
  only when their denominator is present and non-zero. Otherwise the ratio is
  ``None`` with a machine-readable reason, never a fabricated zero.

Transaction-type semantics used here are frozen as module constants
(``TRADE_TYPES``) so the turnover formula is explicit and testable; no ratio or
turnover is ever recomputed on the frontend.
