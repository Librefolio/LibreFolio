"""Crédit Agricole broker report import plugin (BRIM).

Crédit Agricole exports the "Lista Movimenti Deposito Titoli" as both a
**CSV** (``;`` separated, UTF-8 BOM) and an **XLSX** carrying the same data. This
single plugin reads either format: the header row is located dynamically and the
columns are mapped by label, so the leading metadata columns present only in the
XLSX variant are handled transparently.

**Warning language follows the input format.** The only export format supported
today is the Italian one, so user-facing warnings are emitted in Italian. When a
differently localized Crédit Agricole export (a non-Italian entity) is added
later, its warnings should be emitted in that format's language.

**No ISIN** is present — the asset is only identified by its ``Nome``.

Number conventions in this export are mixed and handled per column:
- ``Prezzo`` and ``Controvalore in Euro`` are Italian-formatted (``50.683,13``).
- ``Quantità`` uses dotted decimals for funds (``1867.178``) and plain integers
  for bond nominals (``50000``).
- ``Cambio`` (FX rate) is **ignored** (BRIM never converts currencies).

Causale mapping:
- ``CEDOLA`` -> INTEREST (quantity 0; the nominal in the Quantità column is the
  bond face value, not a trade, so it is ignored). Cash = +Controvalore.
- ``ACQ.CONT.SU MERC.`` / ``SICAV: SOTTOSCR`` -> DEPOSIT + BUY.
- ``FONDI: RIMBORSO`` -> SELL + WITHDRAWAL.
- ``TITOLI SCADUTI`` -> bond redemption at maturity. A bond is always redeemed at
  **par** (100): the SELL closes the *held* nominal at par and any amount the bank
  credited above par (premio fedeltà / ``FOI`` revaluation of a BTP Italia) is
  booked as a separate INTEREST leg (reddito di capitale). The held nominal is
  taken from the position built by the other rows (succession / buys); only when no
  position is found is the nominal derived from Controvalore / Prezzo and flagged
  with a *verify* field-todo. A matching WITHDRAWAL neutralises the par principal.
- ``GIRO ALTRO DOSSIER`` / ``VERS.TITOLI`` -> ADJUSTMENT (cashless transfer-in).
  These are the succession transfers (nonno -> nonna): the receiving leg of a
  transfer whose paying leg lives on another, untracked dossier. No money was
  spent here, so the security is seeded with an ADJUSTMENT that sets the position
  and carries the per-unit book price via ``cost_basis_override`` (bond/fund price
  convention), mirroring the patrimonio-snapshot pattern. No DEPOSIT is emitted, so
  paid-in capital is not inflated. Each source leg is preserved as its own
  ADJUSTMENT with the originating causale kept in the description.

This single plugin also reads the account "Lista Movimenti Conto" cash-movements
layout (``Data Op.;Data Val.;Causale;Descrizione;Importo;Divisa``). Those rows are
bank cash, classified through an explicit **four-tier causale registry** so that no
causale can pass unnoticed:

1. *typed* — FEE/TAX (capital gain, bollo, canone, spese), INTEREST/DIVIDEND
   (coupons/dividends, linked to their security by ISIN when named), or an
   identifiable bond maturity SELL + optional premium INTEREST;
2. *unresolved* — recognised as a securities operation (COMPRAVENDITA) whose
   quantity and instrument this layout does not carry: booked as cash by sign and
   flagged with a **blocker** field-todo carrying the source row as evidence;
3. *declared cash* — POS, utenze, prelievi, emolumenti, giroconto: deposit/withdrawal
   by sign, silently, because here the fallback *is* the right answer;
4. *unknown* — any causale the registry has never seen: same cash fallback plus an
   INFO notice naming it, so a new causale can never enter the fallback quietly.

Tiers 2-4 all produce the same, correct cash movement; they differ only in what the
plugin declares about it. Account-mode transactions keep the bank description
verbatim and carry the causale as a tag.

Because the securities "Deposito Titoli" export is securities-only and does not
include bank cash movements, the plugin adds same-day cash counter-entries so the
broker cash nets to zero: DEPOSIT before every cash BUY, WITHDRAWAL after every
SELL, and a balancing WITHDRAWAL after every coupon (CEDOLA) and maturity-premium
INTEREST leg. Succession transfers carry no counter-entry (a cashless ADJUSTMENT).

The plugin transcribes reported figures verbatim and never calls the FX
subsystem.
