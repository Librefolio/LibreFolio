def restore_registration_setting():
    """Make sure the global settings exist, and that registration is on.

    Almost every API test creates its own user through POST /auth/register, so
    the whole suite depends on `enable_registration` being true. The auth tests
    legitimately flip it to false and restore it in a `finally`, but that
    restore is skipped when a run is killed mid-test (Ctrl-C, a crashed test
    server, a parallel Playwright run recreating the DB). The stale `false`
    then survives into the *next* run and makes ~50 unrelated tests fail with
    "New user registration is disabled" — an error that points nowhere near the
    real cause.

    Seeding the rows, and not merely updating them, matters just as much. The
    settings are created by the app's startup hook, and every API module used to
    start its own server — so a module that wiped `global_settings` was silently
    repaired by the next module's startup. With one server for the whole run
    nobody repairs anything, and an `UPDATE` on a missing row does nothing at
    all: the tests then fail far from the wipe that caused it, with a 404 or an
    assertion about a setting "not initialized".

    The insert mirrors the app's own `initialize_global_settings()`, which is
    likewise "create only what is missing", so a suite that deliberately changes
    a value during the session is unaffected.

    Being `autouse` this runs in **every** pytest process, so under `--workers N`
    all N workers reach this row within a second of each other — including the
    ones classified `pure`, whose "no DB" guarantee this fixture is the sole
    exception to. Hence the read-first fast path below, the explicit timeout (the
    stdlib default is 5s, a sixth of what the app's own engine allows) and the
    closing() wrapper: `with conn` commits but does not close, which would leak
    one connection per worker for the whole session and hold WAL checkpointing
    back.

    A BRIM parse runs in a ``forkserver``-backed process pool. The pool is

    registers — and ``os._exit`` never runs it. What survives is not a zombie
    but a live forkserver plus its workers, re-parented to init and still
    holding the stdout they inherited from pytest. A run piped into ``tee``
    therefore never sees EOF and hangs forever, which is why the project rule
    used to be "never pipe a test run".

    Measured on this exact shape: shutdown(wait=False) immediately before
    os._exit still hangs — the management thread has no chance to send the
    sentinels. Only the join closes the pipe.

    The uvicorn test server runs in a background thread, but Python's

    os._exit() bypasses this. It must run in pytest_unconfigure (not
    pytest_sessionfinish) because pytest_sessionfinish is called *before*
    the terminal reporter prints the FAILURES section and summary line —
    exiting there silently swallows all failure diagnostics.

    And it must flush first, for the same reason. os._exit() skips the
    interpreter's own flush, so whatever is still sitting in the stdout buffer
    is discarded. On a terminal that costs nothing (line-buffered), but every
    run the test runner records goes through a **pipe**, where the buffer is a
    few KB and only full blocks have been written out. The tail is exactly what
    is lost — and the tail is the FAILURES section and the summary line, the two
    things this hook was moved here to preserve. Measured before the fix: every
    per-unit backend log in .testLog ended mid-line at "[100%]" with no summary,
    and `pytest --collect-only` redirected to a file produced zero bytes.
