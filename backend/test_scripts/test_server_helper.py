Test Server Helper

Utilities for managing backend server during API tests.
Auto-starts server on a separate TEST PORT, and stops it after tests.

Test server uses port from TEST_PORT in config.py (default: 6041)
Production server uses PORT from config.py (default: 6040)
Both configurable via environment variables.

Coverage:
---------
Server runs as a THREAD (not subprocess) to enable pytest-cov tracking.
This allows full coverage of endpoint code (backend/app/api/v1/*.py).

With `concurrency = thread,gevent` in .coveragerc:
- ✅ Full async/await tracking in FastAPI handlers
- ✅ ~46-62% endpoint coverage (realistic, test-driven)
- ✅ Tracks all async context switches correctly

This is achieved by:
1. Running uvicorn.run() in a daemon thread (same process as pytest)
2. Using gevent for asyncio event loop instrumentation
3. No subprocess complexity needed

    what they already were in spirit — they all talk HTTP to ``API_BASE``, never
    to the ASGI app in process. Several of them hitting it at once is not a
