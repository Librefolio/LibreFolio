/**
 * Barrel Playwright con raccolta di coverage JS.
 *
 * Gli spec importano da qui invece che da '@playwright/test'. Il modulo
 * ri-esporta gli stessi simboli, quindi per gli spec cambia solo il percorso.
 *
 * La raccolta è attiva solo con COVERAGE_JS=1 (impostato da
 * `./dev.py test --coverage js|all`): a flag spento la fixture esce subito e
 * la corsa normale non paga nulla.
 *
 * Nota sull'architettura: qui si scrive un JSON per test e basta; il report si
 * produce a fine corsa da `scripts/js-coverage-report.js`. È lo stesso schema
 * con cui il backend accumula i `.coverage.<pid>` e poi li unisce con
 * `coverage combine` — e per la stessa ragione: accumulare in memoria dentro il
 * worker è ciò che, sui 25 spec di una categoria consolidata, arrivava a 8 GB.

/**
 * Transaction hygiene — active only when specs share one invocation.
 *
 * `Transaction` is a global table with no `user_id`, so a spec that commits and
 * walks away leaves its rows in every later spec's table. That used to be
 * harmless: one Playwright process per action meant `globalSetup` re-populated
 * before each one, and the leftovers were wiped before anyone tripped over them.
 *
 * Consolidation removes that accident, and the damage is not what one might
 * expect. It is rarely a duplicate key — it is **row inflation**: a spec that
 * scans "the first 20 rows", or reads page one, stops finding the fixture it
 * needs because a hundred rows from earlier specs now sort ahead of it. The
 * failure then names the innocent spec.
 *
 * ### The granularity is per spec file, not per test — and that is the whole point
 *
 * Cleaning after every *test* looks tidier and is wrong. Specs are written
 * sequentially: `tx-commit-all-types` commits a BUY and then sells part of it,
 * `tx-delete` creates a pair in one test and deletes it in the next. Wiping
 * between tests breaks those chains, and measurably did: it turned three reds
 * into five.
 *
 * What consolidation actually removed was the *inter-file* reset — before it,
 * every spec file ran in its own process against a freshly populated database.
 * So that is exactly what this restores: state accumulates freely inside a file,
 * and is rolled back when the file changes and once more at the end of the
 * worker.
 *
 * ### The rollback has to work in both directions
 *
 * Deleting the rows a file added is the cheap half. A file that *destroys* mock
 * rows — `tx-delete` does, by design — cannot be repaired that way, because no
 * API call brings back a row with its original id and its original half of a
 * linked pair. When the baseline ids are no longer all there, the database is
 * repopulated instead. It costs about ten seconds and, measured over the whole
 * `transactions/` directory, happens once.
 *
 * Runs only under `LF_TX_HYGIENE=1`, set by the consolidated pass, so a
 * single-spec run behaves exactly as before.
 *
 * ### Why it switches itself off under parallelism
 *
 * The whole mechanism rests on one assumption: **a worker runs a spec file from
 * start to finish, alone.** That is what makes "delete every transaction id that
 * appeared since I opened this file" a correct description of *my* leftovers.
 *
 * With `fullyParallel: true` the unit of scheduling is the test, not the file:
 * four workers interleave tests from four different files against one database.
 * "Since I opened this file" then also covers the rows the other three workers
 * created for tests that are still running — and `restore()` would delete them
 * out from under them. The repopulate path is worse still: it runs
 * `populate_mock_data --force`, wiping the database while three tests are
 * mid-assertion.
 *
 * So hygiene and cross-file interleaving are mutually exclusive by construction,
 * and hygiene is the half that is no longer needed: it exists to protect tests
 * that read data they did not create, and those are exactly the tests this
 * migration rewrote. Measured without it at four workers: transactions 216/216,
 * assets+fx+utility 298/298.
