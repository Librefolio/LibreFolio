/**
 * Calendar-day arithmetic for `YYYY-MM-DD` strings.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A date-only value has **no time zone**. `2024-12-31` is a day on a calendar, not
 * an instant, and the moment it is treated as one the answer starts depending on
 * where the user is sitting.
 *
 * That is exactly what went wrong in `ScheduledInvestmentEditor`, which did:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const d = new Date(iso + 'T00:00:00');   // midnight LOCAL
 * d.setDate(d.getDate() + days);
 * return d.toISOString().slice(0, 10);     // ...re-projected into UTC
 * ```
 *
 * East of Greenwich, local midnight is the *previous* day in UTC, so the final
 * `slice` hands back a day that is one behind. Measured under `TZ=Europe/Rome`:
 *
 * | call | returned | expected |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `addDays('2024-12-31', +1)` | `2024-12-31` | `2025-01-01` |
 * | `addDays('2024-03-15', -1)` | `2024-03-13` | `2024-03-14` |
 *
 * The second row is the nastier one: a single step backwards moved **two** days,
 * because the DST-free offset and the projection stack. Under `TZ=UTC` — which is
 * what a CI container usually runs — every one of these is correct, so the bug is
 * invisible to a test suite that never leaves Greenwich.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * Stay inside the calendar-day domain from beginning to end. These helpers do the
 * arithmetic in UTC, where a "day" is exactly 24 hours and no offset is ever
 * applied, and never mix in a local-time reading.
 *
 * The one function that *must* read local time is {@link todayIso}: "today" is a
 * question about the user's calendar, not Greenwich's. `new Date().toISOString()`
 * gets that wrong too — at 00:30 in Rome it answers *yesterday*.
