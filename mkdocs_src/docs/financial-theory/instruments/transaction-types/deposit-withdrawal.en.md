**Deposits** and **withdrawals** track the movement of cash into and out of a broker account. They do not involve any asset — only the cash balance changes.

## 💡 Why They Matter

Deposits and withdrawals don't change your portfolio's market value, but they are critical for **performance measurement**:

- **Money-Weighted Return (MWR)**: accounts for timing and size of cash flows — directly affected by deposits/withdrawals
- **Time-Weighted Return (TWR)**: eliminates the effect of cash flows to measure "pure" portfolio performance

Without accurate deposit/withdrawal tracking, it's impossible to distinguish between returns *generated* by the portfolio and returns *caused* by adding/removing cash.

Broker-import nuance: a securities-only export may omit the bank-account cash legs that funded trades or received proceeds. In that case a plugin can auto-generate cash counterparts to keep the imported broker cash neutral: `DEPOSIT + BUY` for a cash purchase, or `SELL + WITHDRAWAL` for a sale/redemption. Crédit Agricole uses this model only for its **Securities Account Activity List**: coupons and maturity premiums remain income, but receive balancing `WITHDRAWAL` entries. Its **Account Activity List** carries real bank cash and does not create those balancing entries.
