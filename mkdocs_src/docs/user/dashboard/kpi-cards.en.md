# 💰 KPI Cards

The three KPI cards at the top of the dashboard give you a quick diagnostic of your portfolio. All values respect the **time range and broker scope** selected at the top of the page.

!!! note "Sharing affects these numbers"

    All amounts are aggregated over the brokers you have access to, and each broker you co-own contributes in proportion to your **ownership share** (e.g. a 50% Owner sees half of that broker's value and P&L). Editors and Viewers, whose share is always 0% by rule, see the broker's full amounts. See [Broker Sharing](../brokers/sharing.md).

## 📉 Card 1 — Period P&L {: #card-1-period-pl }

<div class="kpi-card-crop-container card-period-pnl">
    <img class="gallery-img" data-category="dashboard" data-name="kpi-top" alt="Period P&L Card">
</div>

The **Period P&L** card shows how much money your portfolio actually *earned* in the selected window — after removing the effect of your own deposits and withdrawals.

The hero number is calculated using the following formula:

\[\text{Period P&L} = \text{NAV}_{\text{end}} - \text{NAV}_{\text{start}} - \text{Net Flows}_{\text{period}}\]

A positive number means you earned money from investment activity. A negative number means you lost money net of capital movements.

### The number below the hero

Right under the Period P&L value, a smaller line shows something like `+45.20 (+3.10%)`.

- The amount is the **day-over-day** (today vs. yesterday) change in your **Total P&L** — your all-time accumulated gain/loss, not just the selected period.
- The percentage expresses it as a share of **yesterday's** Total P&L — it tells you how much today's move "weighed" relative to your accumulated all-time result.

\[\text{Daily change} = \text{Total P&L}_{\text{today}} - \text{Total P&L}_{\text{yesterday}}\]

This line only appears once the history has at least two daily points.

### The breakdown rows

| Row | What it measures |
|-----|-----------------|
| **Unrealized change** | How much your open positions' [unrealized gain/loss](../../financial-theory/technical-analysis/performance-metrics/portfolio-engine/book-value.md) changed during the period |
| **Sales** | Realized gain or loss from positions closed during the period (sell price − average cost) |
| **Dividends & interest** | Cash income from dividends, bond coupons, and P2P interest |
| **Fees & taxes** | Commissions and taxes recorded as transactions |

!!! tip "Identity check"

    All four rows add up to the Period P&L hero number (± small residuals from FX rounding).

## 📈 Card 2 — Returns {: #card-2-returns }

<div class="kpi-card-crop-container card-returns">
    <img class="gallery-img" data-category="dashboard" data-name="kpi-top" alt="Returns Card">
</div>

The **Returns** card shows *rate-of-return* metrics — percentages that let you compare performance independently of portfolio size.

### Timing Effect

The **Timing Effect** at the top of the card measures whether your deposit/withdrawal decisions *added* or *subtracted* value compared to a passive buy-and-hold strategy:

\[\text{Timing Effect} = \text{MWRR}_{\text{cumulative}} - \text{TWRR}_{\text{cumulative}}\]

- **Favorable (positive)** ✅: you tended to deposit when prices were low, boosting your personal return above what the assets alone earned.
- **Unfavorable (negative)** ❌: you tended to deposit at peaks or missed dips, dragging your return below pure asset performance.

### The number below the Timing Effect

Below the Timing Effect you'll see a small percentage (e.g. `+0.35%`) — it's the change in your **Total P&L** from **yesterday to today**, expressed as a share of yesterday's net worth:

\[\text{%Daily change} = \frac{\text{Total P&L}_{\text{today}} - \text{Total P&L}_{\text{yesterday}}}{\text{Net Worth}_{\text{yesterday}}} \times 100\]

It's a rough estimate of **today's** return — a quick pulse check. It is not the ROI, TWRR, or MWRR shown in the rows below, which stay anchored to the full selected period.

### The four return metrics

| Metric | Question it answers |
|--------|---------------------|
| **[ROI](../../financial-theory/technical-analysis/performance-metrics/portfolio-engine/roi.md)** | How much did I gain relative to my net invested capital? |
| **[TWRR](../../financial-theory/technical-analysis/performance-metrics/portfolio-engine/twrr.md)** | How did my asset choices perform, independent of when I deposited? |
| **[MWRR cumulative](../../financial-theory/technical-analysis/performance-metrics/portfolio-engine/mwrr.md)** | What is the cumulative money-weighted return for my actual cash flows? |
| **[MWRR annualized](../../financial-theory/technical-analysis/performance-metrics/portfolio-engine/mwrr.md)** | At what yearly compound rate did my capital actually grow? |

!!! note "TWRR vs. MWRR"

    - **[TWRR](../../financial-theory/technical-analysis/performance-metrics/portfolio-engine/twrr.md)** measures the **asset strategy** — same as how a fund manager is evaluated.
    - **[MWRR](../../financial-theory/technical-analysis/performance-metrics/portfolio-engine/mwrr.md)** measures **your personal result** — including the timing of your deposits.
    - The gap between them is the [Timing Effect](../../financial-theory/technical-analysis/performance-metrics/portfolio-engine/timing-effect.md).

## 💰 Card 3 — Net Worth {: #card-3-net-worth }

<div class="kpi-card-crop-container card-net-worth">
    <img class="gallery-img" data-category="dashboard" data-name="kpi-top" alt="Net Worth Card">
</div>

The **Net Worth** card shows the absolute value of your portfolio at the end of the selected period.

!!! note "Net Worth includes cash"

    The figure is **securities at market value + cash balance** (+ any value in transit between brokers). Because it includes liquidity, it is **not comparable** with the "securities value" (controvalore titoli) shown by a bank statement, which excludes cash — a bank's cash balance is reported separately.

### The number below Net Worth

Below the Net Worth value you'll find your **Total P&L**, with your absolute return in parentheses — e.g. `+12,450.30 (+24.85%)`.

- The amount is your **Total P&L** — the gain or loss accumulated since the beginning, across this scope's whole history (not just the current period).
- The percentage in parentheses is the **absolute (since-inception) ROI**: Total P&L ÷ net capital invested since inception. It is *not* a day-over-day change — for that daily pulse check, see the small lines on [Card 1](#card-1-period-pl) and [Card 2](#card-2-returns).

\[\text{Total P&L} = \text{Net Worth} - \text{Net Capital Invested Since Inception}\]

Note: "Net Capital Invested Since Inception" here is the sum of **all** deposits minus **all** withdrawals since you started using this scope — a different, larger figure than the "Deposited Capital" row below, which only counts movements within the selected period.

🔗 **Theory**: [Deposited Capital, Total PnL and Cash Pools](../../financial-theory/technical-analysis/performance-metrics/portfolio-engine/deposited-capital.md)

### What the rows mean

| Row | Definition |
|-----|-----------|
| **[Market Value](../../financial-theory/technical-analysis/performance-metrics/portfolio-engine/nav.md)** | Current market price × quantity for all held assets |
| **[Book Value](../../financial-theory/technical-analysis/performance-metrics/portfolio-engine/book-value.md)** | What you paid for your open positions (average cost × qty) |
| **Cash** | Liquid balance held in broker accounts |
| **[Deposited Capital](../../financial-theory/technical-analysis/performance-metrics/portfolio-engine/deposited-capital.md)** | Net external capital contributed to this scope |

### The Deposited Capital bar

The horizontal bar below the rows visualizes:

- 🟢 **Total deposited** — all deposits in the period
- 🔴 **Total withdrawn** — all withdrawals in the period

The hero number shows the net balance (deposited − withdrawn).

!!! info "Point-in-time vs. period"

    Market Value, Book Value, and Cash are **snapshots** at the end date — they are independent of the start date.
    Deposited Capital is **period-scoped** — it counts deposits and withdrawals between the start and end of the selected range.
