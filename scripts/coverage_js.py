"""
JS/Svelte coverage adapter for `coverage_analysis.py`.

`coverage_analysis.py` was written against the JSON produced by coverage.py:
a `files` mapping where every file carries a `functions` block with a ready-made
`summary`. Monocart writes the istanbul format instead — a flat mapping of files,
each with `statementMap`/`fnMap` and the raw hit counters `s`/`f`.

This module converts one into the other so a single analyser serves both
languages, and supplies the JS-specific classification rules (the Python ones
speak of providers and Pydantic schemas, which say nothing about a SvelteKit app).

Two properties of the input shape the whole design:

1. **`.svelte` files have no function names.** The Svelte compiler turns markup
   into closures, so every entry is `(anonymous_N)`. Names are therefore rebuilt
   from the source position (`block@142`), which is what a developer needs anyway
   to find the code. `.ts` files keep their real names.

2. **Statements are attributed by line range.** istanbul does not say which
   statement belongs to which function, so statements are matched against the
   function's `loc`. A nested closure is thus counted twice: once for itself and
   once for its parent. This is a ranking heuristic, not an exact metric — good
   enough to sort untested code by weight, not to be quoted as a percentage.

3. **The unit is the line, not the statement.** The combined report merges two
   compilations of the same `.svelte` file (vitest for jsdom, the production
   build for E2E), and their statement positions do not coincide, so the merged
   denominator counts one file twice. Lines survive that far better. See
   `_statements_in_range` for the measurement and why it matters.

    Counted by line, not by statement, and that is a correction rather than a
    simplification. The combined report merges two measurements of the same
    ``.svelte`` file compiled twice — once by vitest for jsdom, once by the
    production build the E2E suite drives — and the Svelte compiler emits
    different code each time. Statement *positions* therefore do not line up:
    ``DataTableColumnFilter`` had 532 statements under vitest, 484 under E2E and
    791 in the merge, of which only 225 positions were shared. The merged
    denominator was the union of two maps of one file.

    That inflated 2 163 statements across 89 files, and it did so precisely on the
    files that have a component test — so adding one made a file's combined number
    look *worse*, and this analyser, which reads the combined report, sent us to
    write tests for code that was already covered by the other level.

    Lines survive the double compilation far better (356 of ~450 shared on that
    same file), so they are the stable unit here. A line counts as covered when any
    statement on it ran, which is what line coverage has always meant.
