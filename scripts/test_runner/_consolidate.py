"""
Frontend consolidation: one invocation per category instead of one per action.

## Why

A frontend action pays, before it tries anything: a database populate, eight user
creations, a Playwright `globalSetup` that populates and creates users *again*, and
a webServer start/stop. Roughly eleven cold Python starts per spec file. Measured
on `front-fx`: seven Playwright invocations run 42 tests in 502.6 s, while a single
invocation runs *those same 42 tests plus 21 more* — 63 in all — in 218.6 s.

So the largest cost in the frontend suite is not the tests: it is invoking them.

## What this does

`./dev.py test front-transaction all` runs every Playwright spec of the category in
**one** invocation, and every vitest file in **one** more. `./dev.py test
front-transaction tx-delete` is untouched — a single action still means a single
spec, exactly as before.

## Why per-unit outcomes come with it, not after it

Consolidation alone would make the runner report "the category passed" instead of
naming which spec failed, and would coarsen `--resume` from a spec to a whole
category. That is a regression, so the reporters are read back here: Playwright
writes a JSON report, vitest writes one too, and each is folded back into a
per-spec verdict. The action-level summary the runner prints stays exactly as
detailed as it was.

## The precondition

Consolidation makes specs share a database, which is only safe once every spec
cleans up what it commits. That rule — and the `db-cleanup.ts` helper that
implements it for E2E — is documented in `runner_architecture.md`. It is a real
precondition: `tx-clone` committing a clone of the `delete-safe` ETH pair broke
`tx-delete` the first time these two shared an invocation.

      that re-launches the same four specs the individual actions own. Recording
      every claimant means each action gets a verdict from the one run, instead
      of one action winning the spec and the other being re-run serially.
