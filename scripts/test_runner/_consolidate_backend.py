"""
Backend consolidation: one pytest invocation per category instead of one per unit.

## Why

Every backend unit is its own `pipenv run python -m pytest <file>`. Measured, the
fixed cost of that invocation — pipenv resolution, interpreter start, importing
the whole FastAPI app, SQLModel and every provider — is **2.6 s**, while
collecting all 47 `test_api` files at once costs **3.7 s** in total. So `api all`
spends roughly two minutes of its seven doing nothing but starting Python 47
times, and `services`, with 85 units, pays more still.

Measured end to end on `test_api`: 47 invocations took 458 s, one invocation ran
the same 564 tests in 367 s. Twenty per cent of the category, recovered without
touching a single test.

## What this does

`./dev.py test api all` runs every registered pytest unit of the category in
**one** invocation. `./dev.py test api auth` is untouched — a single action still
means a single file, exactly as before.

## Why per-unit outcomes come with it, not after it

Consolidation alone would report "the category passed" instead of naming the file
that failed, and would coarsen `--resume` from a unit to a whole category. So the
junit report is read back and folded into a per-file verdict, exactly as the
frontend pass does with Playwright's and vitest's JSON reports. The per-action
summary the runner prints stays as detailed as it was.

## What is deliberately not consolidated

- **`db`** is a lifecycle, not a batch: its actions create the schema, validate
  it and populate it, in that order, and some of them *are* the side effect. It
  keeps its 1:1 shape.
- **`external`** filters its units by provider (`--providers`, `--exclude-providers`).
  One invocation would silently ignore that filter.
- **Units already claimed by the parallel pre-pass**, which runs first: they have
  been executed, and re-running them here would double both the time and the
  coverage.

## The precondition

One invocation means one pytest session, so the session-scoped fixtures in
`conftest.py` — notably the settings seeding — run once instead of once per unit.
That is only safe when no unit destroys shared state that a later one needs. It
was verified rather than assumed: all 47 serial `test_api` units in a single
session gave 564 passed, 3 skipped, 0 failed.
