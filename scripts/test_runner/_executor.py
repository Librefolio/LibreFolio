"""Execution: run a plan's groups as concurrent workers, isolated by resources.

A worker does not merely get permission to run — it gets a lot of exclusive
resources. Today that lot is one thing, ``COVERAGE_FILE``, because only PURE
units are parallelised and they need nothing else. The database, the port and
the E2E user join the lot when the write classes are activated; the shape here
is built to take them.

The failure policy is deliberate: at the first red the scheduler stops handing
out work, but workers already running are left to finish. Killing a worker
mid-flight loses its coverage, and coverage that goes missing without failing
is the most expensive kind of defect this project has met.
