"""Derived inventory of what the test runner can actually run.

The runner has no notion of "a test unit": each action function reports,
prepares the environment and spawns its own process, so nothing outside the
action knows what it will launch until it launches it. That is what makes the
``all`` lists drift, the orphan check unable to prove reachability, and any
scheduling impossible.

This module derives that missing object. The action functions are near-pure
command producers, so replacing the few launch points with collectors lets us
invoke them and record *what they would run* without paying the cost of running
it. Everything else — reachability checks, ``all`` lists, scheduling — is then
a projection of the inventory rather than a hand-written list.
