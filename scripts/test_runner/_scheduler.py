"""Scheduling: turn the inventory plus a worker count into an execution plan.

The plan is the only place that decides *what runs with what*. It answers one
question — can these two units share a machine? — and it answers it from the
isolation class, never from the name of a test or the shape of a directory.

Only PURE is parallelised today. READ and WRITE-SCOPED are real classes with
real potential, but they must be declared per unit before they can be trusted;
until then the strict default holds and they stay serial. Over-serialising
costs time, and time is cheap compared with an intermittent red.
