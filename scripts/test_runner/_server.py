"""
One test server for the whole run.

Until now every ``test_api`` module started its own uvicorn in a thread, so the
FastAPI app was imported from scratch 47 times per run — measured at roughly 11
of the 15 minutes those invocations cost. It also made the modules mutually
exclusive by construction: two of them could never be in flight at once.

The lifecycle here is not new. ``frontend/playwright.config.ts`` has been
starting the backend exactly this way for a long time, as an *external* process
under ``coverage run``, and that is the part worth copying rather than
reinventing — including the detail that kills runs silently:

    Playwright gracefulShutdown SIGTERM → /bin/sh exec → dev.py os.execvpe()
    → pipenv os.execvpe() → coverage run receives SIGTERM → writes .coverage.<pid>

Every link in that chain uses ``exec`` so the signal reaches ``coverage`` itself.
A SIGKILL anywhere along it discards the whole run's backend coverage without a
word — which is precisely how coverage vanished twice during P7.
